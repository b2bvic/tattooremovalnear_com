# The Tattoo Removal Clinic Safety Scorecard
## 15 Red Flags to Avoid Disaster

---

You're trusting someone to fire a medical laser at your skin 8-12 times. One unqualified technician or poorly maintained device leaves permanent scarring, hyperpigmentation, or results so poor you've wasted thousands of dollars. Most people choose clinics based on Groupon deals or proximity.

That's gambling with your skin.

Professional tattoo removal requires three elements working together: board-certified medical oversight, FDA-cleared laser equipment with proper maintenance, and proven protocols for your specific skin type and ink colors. Missing any one component increases complication risk by 300%.

This scorecard evaluates all three.

---

## How to Use This Scorecard

Print this document. Bring it to every consultation. Score each clinic as you gather information. Don't book until you've evaluated at least three providers.

**Scoring:**
- Each item scores 0 (fail) or 1 (pass)
- 13-15: Strong candidate
- 10-12: Proceed with caution, request clarification on failed items
- Below 10: Walk away

**Dealbreakers:** Tier 1 items are non-negotiable. Any Tier 1 failure = automatic disqualification regardless of total score.

---

## TIER 1: DEALBREAKERS

*Failure on any Tier 1 item disqualifies the clinic immediately. No exceptions.*

### 1. Medical License Verification

**What to verify:** The person performing your treatment holds a valid state medical license appropriate for laser procedures.

**How to verify:**
- Ask for the operator's full name and license number
- Search your state medical board website
- Look for active status, no disciplinary actions

**State Medical Board Lookup:**
- Search "[your state] medical board license lookup"
- Enter provider name or license number
- Verify active status and expiration date

**Red flag:** Clinic refuses to provide operator name or license number. Operator is "certified" but not licensed. License lookup shows expired, revoked, or non-existent license.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 2. Laser FDA Clearance

**What to verify:** The laser device used for your treatment has FDA 510(k) clearance for tattoo removal.

**How to verify:**
- Ask for the exact laser model and manufacturer
- Search FDA 510(k) database: accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm
- Confirm clearance for "tattoo removal" indication

**Common FDA-cleared devices:**
- PicoWay (Candela) — 510(k) K153039
- PicoSure (Cynosure) — 510(k) K121486
- Enlighten (Cutera) — 510(k) K171456
- Q-Switch Nd:YAG (various manufacturers)

**Red flag:** Clinic can't name specific laser model. Device not found in FDA database. Clearance is for skin rejuvenation only (not tattoo removal).

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 3. Professional Liability Insurance

**What to verify:** The clinic carries medical malpractice and liability insurance covering laser procedures.

**How to verify:**
- Ask directly: "Do you carry malpractice insurance covering laser tattoo removal?"
- Request certificate of insurance showing policy limits and coverage dates
- Minimum acceptable: $1 million per occurrence

**Red flag:** No insurance. Evasive answers. Insurance doesn't specifically cover laser procedures. Coverage has lapsed.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

## TIER 2: MAJOR CONCERNS

*Failures here warrant serious questions. Two or more Tier 2 failures = consider alternative clinics.*

### 4. Provider Training Documentation

**What to verify:** The operator has specific training in laser tattoo removal beyond basic certification.

**Questions to ask:**
- "How many hours of laser-specific training have you completed?"
- "Where did you receive your training?"
- "How many tattoo removal procedures have you performed?"

**Acceptable minimums:**
- 40+ hours hands-on laser training
- Training from device manufacturer or accredited institution
- 500+ tattoo removal procedures performed

**Red flag:** Weekend certification only. No manufacturer-specific training. Fewer than 100 procedures performed. Training was "on the job."

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 5. Equipment Age and Maintenance

**What to verify:** The laser equipment is reasonably current and properly maintained.

**Questions to ask:**
- "What year was your laser purchased?"
- "When was the last service/calibration?"
- "Do you have maintenance records?"

**Acceptable standards:**
- Equipment less than 10 years old
- Calibration within past 12 months
- Written maintenance log available upon request

**Red flag:** Equipment older than 2016. Can't recall last service date. No documentation. Uses refurbished or "gray market" equipment.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 6. Test Patch Protocol

**What to verify:** The clinic offers or requires a test patch before full treatment, especially for darker skin tones or complex ink.

**Questions to ask:**
- "Do you offer a test patch?"
- "For which patients do you recommend test patches?"
- "Is the test patch included in the consultation fee?"

**Best practice:**
- Test patch offered to all patients
- Required for Fitzpatrick III-VI skin types
- 4-6 week wait after test patch before proceeding

**Red flag:** No test patch available. Test patch costs extra significant amount. Provider dismisses test patch as unnecessary for darker skin.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 7. Skin Type Assessment (Fitzpatrick Scale)

**What to verify:** Provider assesses your skin type and adjusts protocols accordingly.

**Questions to ask:**
- "How do you determine my skin type?"
- "How does skin type affect your treatment approach?"
- "What laser settings do you use for my skin type?"

**What provider should do:**
- Assess Fitzpatrick type (I-VI) during consultation
- Explain wavelength selection based on skin type
- Discuss pigmentation risks for darker skin
- Recommend conservative settings for Types IV-VI

**Red flag:** No skin type assessment. Same settings for all patients. Dismisses hyperpigmentation concerns. Uses 755nm laser on Type V-VI skin.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 8. Wavelength Capabilities

**What to verify:** The clinic's laser can treat your specific ink colors.

**Wavelength requirements by color:**
- Black/dark blue: 1064nm Nd:YAG (any)
- Red/orange: 532nm
- Green/light blue: 755nm or 730nm
- Yellow/pastels: Difficult with any single wavelength

**Questions to ask:**
- "What wavelengths does your laser have?"
- "Which wavelength will you use for my [specific color] ink?"
- "What's your approach for [stubborn color] removal?"

**Red flag:** Single-wavelength laser for multicolor tattoo. Claims any wavelength works on any color. Can't explain wavelength selection logic.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 9. Transparent Pricing

**What to verify:** Clinic provides clear, written pricing before you commit.

**What to request:**
- Per-session cost for your specific tattoo
- Package pricing terms (if offered)
- Additional fees (numbing, aftercare, touch-ups)
- Refund/cancellation policy in writing

**Red flag:** Won't quote price without package commitment. Verbal pricing only. Hidden consultation fees applied to first treatment. Pressured to decide same day.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 10. Realistic Session Estimates

**What to verify:** Provider gives evidence-based session estimates, not lowball promises.

**What to expect:**
- Provider uses Kirby-Desai scale or similar assessment
- Range given (not single number): "6-10 sessions typical"
- Factors discussed: ink density, colors, location, skin type
- Acknowledgment that some ink may never fully clear

**Red flag:** Fixed session count promised. "6 sessions guaranteed" claims. No discussion of variables affecting removal. Provider never mentions possibility of incomplete removal.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

## TIER 3: QUALITY INDICATORS

*These items distinguish good clinics from excellent ones. Failures are concerning but not disqualifying alone.*

### 11. Before/After Portfolio

- Multiple examples, not cherry-picked
- Shows realistic outcomes including incomplete removals
- Willing to share portfolio via email for review

**Red flag:** No portfolio available. Stock photos or internet images. Only shows perfect outcomes. Refuses to share digitally.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 12. Complication Management Protocol

**What to verify:** Clinic has procedures for handling adverse reactions.

**Questions to ask:**
- "What happens if I develop hyperpigmentation?"
- "How do you handle blistering or scarring?"
- "Is there a physician available for complications?"
- "Do I have access to after-hours contact for urgent concerns?"

**What to expect:**
- Written complication protocol
- Physician oversight or referral pathway
- 24-48 hour response commitment for urgent issues
- Follow-up appointments for complications at no extra charge

**Red flag:** "We've never had complications." No protocol exists. Complications would require separate physician visit at your expense.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 13. Pain Management Options

**What to verify:** Multiple pain management options are available.

**Options to ask about:**
- Topical numbing cream (BLT or lidocaine)

- Nitrous oxide (Pronox) for sensitive areas

**What to expect:**
- At minimum: topical + cooling available

**Red flag:** Verbal instructions only. Generic aftercare sheet not specific to laser treatment. No contact information for questions.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

---

### 15. Consultation Process Quality

**What to verify:** The consultation is educational, not a high-pressure sales pitch.

**Quality markers:**
- Time taken to examine your tattoo
- Questions about your goals (complete removal vs. cover-up prep)
- Medical history review (medications, conditions, allergies)
- Explanation of process, timeline, realistic expectations
- No pressure to book or pay same day

**Red flag:** Under 10 minutes. No examination of tattoo. No medical history questions. "Special pricing if you book today." Hard close tactics.

**Score:** [ ] Pass / [ ] Fail

## WALK-OUT TRIGGERS

Leave the consultation immediately if you hear:

1. **"We guarantee complete removal."** — Impossible to guarantee. Too many variables.

2. **"Our laser works on any tattoo in 6 sessions."** — Session count depends on ink density, colors, location, skin type. Fixed promises are lies.

3. **"The price is only valid if you book today."** — High-pressure sales tactic. Quality clinics don't need urgency.

4. **"You don't need a test patch."** — For Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin, test patches prevent permanent pigmentation damage.

5. **Operator can't answer basic questions about laser wavelength, their training, or skin type protocols.** — Incompetence or undertrained staff.

6. **No written anything** — no written pricing, no written aftercare, no written refund policy. If it's not in writing, it doesn't exist.

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Score 3 clinics minimum** — The first consultation teaches you what questions you forgot. The second lets you compare. The third confirms patterns.

2. **Book only with clinics scoring 13+** — Anything lower means unacceptable risk.

3. **If all three score poorly** — Expand your search radius. A 60-minute drive to a qualified clinic beats permanent scarring from a convenient one.

4. **Get your cost estimate** — Use our True Cost Calculator at [tattooremovalnear.com/calculator] to understand realistic pricing before you negotiate.

5. **Prepare for pain management** — Download the Pain-Free Protocol at [tattooremovalnear.com/pain-protocol] for the 7-step system that reduces discomfort by 80%.

## YOUR SKIN. YOUR DECISION.

This scorecard exists because the tattoo removal industry has misaligned incentives. Clinics profit from sessions, not results. Consultations are designed to close sales, not inform decisions.

You now have the evaluation framework they hope you never find.
