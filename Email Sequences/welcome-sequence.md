## Email 1: Welcome + Problem Validation

**Subject Line:** Your clinic is hiding something
**Preview Text:** And it's costing you thousands...
**Send Timing:** Day 0 (immediate delivery)
**PASAIDA Focus:** Problem + Agitation

You downloaded the Clinic Vetting Scorecard because you're researching tattoo removal. That puts you ahead of 95% of people who book based on proximity and Groupon deals.

Those people end up with patchy fading, permanent hyperpigmentation, or 15 sessions instead of the promised 8.

Your scorecard is attached. Use it at every consultation you schedule.

But first, understand why this scorecard exists at all.

Tattoo removal clinics profit when you book sessions. Not when you get results. That incentive structure creates predictable problems:

Pricing hidden behind consultations. They need you emotionally committed before revealing $3,000-8,000 total costs. If you knew upfront, you'd comparison shop.

Session count underestimation. The consultation estimate is 6-8 sessions. The reality for your tattoo type might be 12-14. But by the time you realize, you've already bought a package.

Outdated technology. Q-Switch lasers cost less to operate than picosecond systems. They're also 30-40% less effective. Clinics running old equipment don't advertise that.

Under-trained operators. Board-certified dermatologist on the website. Med spa technician with a weekend certification actually firing the laser at your skin.

The scorecard identifies these patterns before you hand over $500 for a package that goes nowhere.

Your assignment tonight: Read Section 1 (Dealbreakers). Three Tier 1 criteria. If a clinic fails any of them, walk out. No negotiation. No second chances.

Tomorrow's email covers the technology lie you'll hear at 80% of consultations.

## Email 2: Authority + Education

**Subject Line:** "Our PicoSure removes any tattoo in 6 sessions"
**Preview Text:** Sure it does. Let me explain why that's impossible.

Picosecond lasers outperform Q-Switch technology. Faster fading, fewer sessions, reduced scarring risk. The clinical data supports this.

But picosecond lasers aren't magic. And clinics selling them as miracle devices are lying to close the sale.

Here's the lie: "Our PicoSure removes any tattoo in 6 sessions."

Here's the physics:

PicoSure operates at 755nm wavelength. That wavelength targets black and dark blue ink effectively. Red ink moderately. Green and yellow poorly.

Your multicolor tattoo with green highlights? PicoSure alone won't clear it. Not in 6 sessions. Not in 16 sessions. The wavelength doesn't match the ink absorption spectrum.

Complete multicolor removal requires multiple wavelengths:
- 1064nm for black and deep pigment
- 532nm for red, orange, and yellow
- 755nm or 730nm for blues and greens

PicoWay offers three wavelengths (532nm, 730nm, 1064nm). That's why it handles full-spectrum removal. PicoSure has one. Enlighten has two.

A clinic claiming "any tattoo in 6 sessions" with a single-wavelength system either doesn't understand laser physics or is deliberately misleading you.

The scorecard Section 2, Question 8 tells you exactly what to ask about wavelength capabilities. If they can't explain why their specific laser matches your specific ink colors, you have your answer.

I've built a full technology comparison covering PicoSure, PicoWay, Enlighten, and Q-Switch variants. Includes FDA clearance data, clinical efficacy rates by ink color, and per-session cost ranges.

Read it before your next consultation. Then watch the sales pitch collapse when you ask informed questions.

## Email 3: Solution + Incentive

**Subject Line:** Package pricing is a trap
**Preview Text:** Here's how to pay less and get more.
**Send Timing:** Day 3
**PASAIDA Focus:** Solution + Incentive

---

Clinics love package pricing.

"Buy 6 sessions upfront, save 20%!"

Sounds reasonable until you map the incentives.

You don't know if you need 6 sessions or 12. The clinic does know your tattoo characteristics suggest 10-12 sessions, but they quoted 6-8 during consultation because honesty kills conversions.

Package deals lock you in before you see results. Three sessions in, fading stalls, you want to switch clinics. Good luck getting a refund. Those policies exist to keep your money, not protect you.

The clinic profits from your uncertainty. You absorb the risk.

Better approach: Per-session pricing with a cost cap.

The script goes like this:

"I'll pay your standard per-session rate. If treatment exceeds X sessions, you cap my total at $Y. That protects me from open-ended costs and gives you confidence in your quoted timeline."

Not every clinic negotiates this. The ones that refuse tell you something important: they expect your treatment to exceed their quote and they want to profit from every extra session.

The ones that agree? They're confident in their technology and protocols. They believe they'll clear your tattoo in the estimated range. Those are the clinics worth booking.

I've included negotiation scripts in the cost calculator. If you haven't downloaded it yet, it shows you realistic cost ranges for your specific tattoo based on 850-clinic pricing data across 50 US markets.

Use it to anchor your negotiation. "I've researched average costs for tattoos like mine. Your quoted rate is 30% above market median. Can you match the benchmark or offer a cap?"

Data gives you leverage. Leverage gets you better deals.

**Subject Line:** Your ankle tattoo will cost 40% more
**Preview Text:** Body location determines session count. Here's the map.

Tattoo removal cost isn't just about size and ink colors. It's about where the tattoo sits on your body.

Same tattoo. Same technology. Different location. Dramatically different outcomes.

The mechanism: Your body clears fragmented ink through the lymphatic system. Lymphatic drainage and blood circulation vary by body region.

Upper arms and shoulders. Rich blood supply. Efficient lymphatic drainage. Average clearance: 6-8 sessions.

Chest and upper back. Strong circulation. Similar efficiency. Average clearance: 6-8 sessions.

Forearms and calves. Moderate circulation. Slightly slower drainage. Average clearance: 8-10 sessions.

Hands and feet. Poor peripheral circulation. Sluggish lymphatic flow. Average clearance: 10-15+ sessions.

Ankles specifically. Among the worst locations for removal. Combined poor circulation and thin skin create slower fading and higher complication risk.

Run the math: An upper arm tattoo at $350/session for 7 sessions totals $2,450. The same tattoo on your ankle at $350/session for 12 sessions totals $4,200.

71% cost increase. Same ink. Same size. Same technology.

Most clinics don't volunteer this information during consultations. They want you committed before the timeline math hits.

Some providers refuse hands and feet entirely because outcomes are unpredictable and patient satisfaction drops. That's actually a good sign. They're honest about limitations rather than taking your money for poor results.

Check your tattoo location before booking. If it's in a high-difficulty zone (hands, feet, ankles, fingers, toes), budget accordingly. Ask providers specifically about their experience and outcomes with that body area.

I've mapped every location by removal difficulty, expected session count, and pain intensity. The guide shows you exactly what to expect based on where your tattoo sits.

## Email 5: Action + Deadline (Soft)

**Subject Line:** You're ready to book (use this checklist)
**Preview Text:** Final steps before your consultations.
**Send Timing:** Day 7
**PASAIDA Focus:** Action

You have the scorecard, the technology breakdown, the cost calculator, and the body location guide.

You're more informed than 95% of people walking into consultations this month.

Now execute.

Schedule 3 consultations. Not 1. Three minimum.

First consultation teaches you what questions you forgot to ask. Second consultation reveals different approaches and pricing structures. Third consultation establishes patterns and lets you compare objectively.

One consultation creates emotional attachment without comparison. Three consultations create informed decisions.

Booking process:

1. Use the verified clinic directory for your metro area. Filter by technology type matching your ink colors.

2. Call each clinic. Confirm they offer free consultations. If they charge for consultations, ask what's included. Some consultation fees apply toward treatment if you book.

3. Bring your printed scorecard. Take notes during the consultation. Score each clinic on all 15 criteria before you leave the building.

4. After all three consultations, compare scores side by side. Book only with the highest scorer.

If all three score below 13/15, expand your search radius. Do not settle for a mediocre clinic because it's 10 minutes closer. This is your skin. For years.

Red flags that end a consultation immediately:

Guaranteed complete removal promises. Impossible to guarantee. Every tattoo responds differently.

High-pressure package sales before you leave. They need your money more than they need your satisfaction.

No FDA clearance documentation for their laser when requested. Either the device isn't cleared or they don't want you asking questions.

No test patch offering for Fitzpatrick III+ skin types. They lack dark skin expertise or don't prioritize your safety.

Refusal to discuss session count ranges or provide cost cap options. They're planning to profit from extended treatment.

These triggers are added to your scorecard under Section 3: Walk-Out Criteria.

Book your consultations this week. You've invested time learning how to evaluate clinics. Now apply it.

After you've completed all three consultations, reply to this email with your scores. I read every response. I'll tell you if your top-choice clinic looks solid or if the scores suggest concerns.

Forward this series to anyone you know researching removal. The information should be standard. It isn't.
