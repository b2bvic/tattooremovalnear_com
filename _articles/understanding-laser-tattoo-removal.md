## How Laser Tattoo Removal Works

Laser tattoo removal is a widely recognized and effective method for getting rid of unwanted tattoos. The process involves the use of highly concentrated light beams (lasers) that penetrate the skin and target the tattoo ink.

### The Science Bit

- **Targeting Ink Particles**: The laser energy is selectively absorbed by the tattoo ink particles, leaving the surrounding skin and tissue largely unaffected.
- **Breaking Down Ink**: Upon absorption, the laser energy causes the ink particles to heat up and shatter into tiny fragments.
- **Body's Natural Elimination**: Over the weeks following a treatment session, the body's immune system recognizes these fragmented particles as foreign and works to clear them away. This is why multiple sessions are usually required, as the body gradually flushes out the ink.

Different laser wavelengths are used to target different colors of ink, making it a versatile solution for most tattoos.
