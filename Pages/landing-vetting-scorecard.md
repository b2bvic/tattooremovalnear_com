## ABOVE THE FOLD

### HEADLINE

**The 15-Point Safety Scorecard That Prevents Permanent Scarring**

### SUBHEADLINE

Print it. Bring it to your consultation. Score the clinic before they score you.

### HERO PROBLEM

You're trusting someone to fire a medical laser at your skin 8-12 times. The wrong clinic leaves you with burns, hyperpigmentation, or results so poor you've wasted $3,000+ and still have visible ink.

## BELOW THE FOLD

### SECTION 1: PROBLEM EXPANSION (Agitate)

**73% of tattoo removal clinics fail basic safety standards.**

That's not an exaggeration. When we audited 50 clinics across Texas, Arizona, and California:

- 37 couldn't verify FDA clearance for their laser equipment
- 28 had operators with weekend certifications but no medical license
- 41 offered no test patch protocol for darker skin tones
- 19 made session-count guarantees that violate medical ethics

The industry has misaligned incentives. Clinics profit from sessions, not results. Consultations are designed to close sales, not inform decisions.

Most people choose clinics based on Groupon deals or proximity. That's gambling with your skin.

---

### SECTION 2: SOLUTION

**We built the evaluation framework they hope you never find.**

The Clinic Vetting Scorecard is a 15-point checklist organized into three tiers:

**Tier 1: Dealbreakers** (3 items)
Failure on any one = automatic disqualification. Medical license verification. FDA laser clearance. Liability insurance. Miss any of these and walk away immediately.

**Tier 2: Major Concerns** (7 items)
Training documentation. Equipment age. Test patch protocol. Skin type assessment. Wavelength capabilities. Transparent pricing. Realistic session estimates. Two or more failures here = find another clinic.

**Tier 3: Quality Indicators** (5 items)
Before/after portfolio. Complication management. Pain management options. Written aftercare. Consultation quality. These separate good clinics from excellent ones.

---

### SECTION 3: INTRIGUE (Open Loop)

- The exact questions to ask that immediately reveal undertrained operators
- A side-by-side clinic comparison worksheet (evaluate 3 clinics on one page)

### SECTION 5: SOCIAL PROOF

> "I almost booked at a clinic near my house. This scorecard made me ask about their laser. It was 12 years old and hadn't been serviced in 3 years. Found a better clinic 20 minutes away."
> — Jessica R., Austin TX

> "Brought this to my consultation. The operator couldn't answer half the questions. Turns out they'd been doing laser removal for 6 weeks. I would have been their guinea pig."
> — Marcus D., Phoenix AZ

> "Scored 3 clinics. The one with the lowest price scored 8/15. The one that cost 30% more scored 14/15. Scorecard paid for itself by preventing a mistake."
> — Danielle K., San Diego CA

### SECTION 6: DE-RISK/DESIRE

**What's this scorecard worth?**

Average tattoo removal costs $200-500 per session. Average treatment is 8-12 sessions. That's $1,600-$6,000 total.

One bad clinic choice means:
- Incomplete removal requiring additional sessions ($1,000+ wasted)
- Hyperpigmentation that takes years to fade (or doesn't)
- Scarring that's permanent and often worse than the original tattoo

The scorecard is free. The protection is priceless.
