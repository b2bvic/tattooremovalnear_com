# PicoSure vs PicoWay: Which Picosecond Laser Removes Tattoos Better?

**PicoSure** and **PicoWay** represent the two dominant picosecond laser platforms for tattoo removal, each employing distinct wavelengths and pulse characteristics that determine optimal ink color targeting. **PicoSure** operates primarily at 755nm with 750 picosecond pulses, excelling on green, blue, and stubborn multi-color tattoos. **PicoWay** delivers 1064nm, 785nm, and 532nm wavelengths at 294-450 picosecond durations, demonstrating superior performance on black ink and providing more versatile multi-wavelength options within single devices. Neither technology categorically outperforms the other—selection depends on tattoo ink composition, skin type, and treatment priorities.

## Wavelength Differences and Ink Targeting

Wavelength selection determines which ink colors absorb laser energy most efficiently:

**PicoSure 755nm Primary Wavelength**: The alexandrite-based 755nm wavelength targets melanin, green, and blue pigments preferentially. Green ink demonstrates 60-80% greater absorption at 755nm versus 1064nm, making **PicoSure** the gold standard for recalcitrant green tattoos resistant to Q-switched removal. Blue inks respond well but not as dramatically as greens. Black ink absorption remains moderate—adequate for removal but less efficient than longer wavelengths.

**PicoWay 1064nm Primary Wavelength**: This Nd:YAG wavelength penetrates deeply with minimal melanin absorption, ideal for black, blue, and brown inks. Carbon-based black pigments demonstrate peak absorption in the 1000-1100nm range, making 1064nm optimal for the majority of tattoo removal cases (professional black ink constitutes 60% of removal procedures). Safe for all Fitzpatrick skin types including VI due to minimal epidermal melanin interaction.

**PicoWay 532nm Secondary Wavelength**: Frequency-doubled output targets red, orange, yellow, and purple inks. Red pigment absorption peaks at 532nm, achieving 70-85% clearance rates superior to any other wavelength. However, 532nm demonstrates high melanin absorption, restricting use on Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin to minimize hyperpigmentation risks.

**PicoWay 785nm Tertiary Wavelength**: Intermediate wavelength balances melanin safety with multi-color targeting. Addresses blue, green, and purple inks while maintaining lower PIH risk than 532nm on darker skin. Less commonly deployed than 1064nm or 532nm—reserved for specific ink combinations.

**PicoSure 532nm and 1064nm Options**: While **PicoSure** focuses on 755nm, **Cynosure** manufactures 532nm and 1064nm handpieces for **PicoSure** platforms. However, these remain less common than **PicoWay**'s integrated multi-wavelength approach. Most **PicoSure** clinics operate 755nm exclusively, requiring patient referrals to complementary **Nd:YAG** providers for red ink components.

## Pulse Duration and Fragmentation Mechanics

Subtle pulse duration differences influence ink fragmentation efficiency:

**PicoSure Pulse Duration**: 750 picoseconds at 755nm. This represents the original picosecond pulse duration that established photoacoustic superiority over nanosecond systems. The 750ps timeframe delivers sufficient peak power to generate shockwaves while allowing focused energy delivery.

**PicoWay Pulse Duration**: 294-450 picoseconds depending on wavelength. The shorter pulse compresses energy into briefer timeframes, theoretically generating more intense photoacoustic pressure waves. Clinical studies show 10-15% faster per-session clearance with **PicoWay** on black ink compared to **PicoSure**, though total session count differences often amount to just 1-2 treatments.

**Practical Implications**: Both systems fragment ink through photoacoustic shockwaves rather than photothermal heating. The 300-450 picosecond difference between systems matters less than wavelength selection for target ink colors. A 755nm **PicoSure** pulse removes green ink more effectively than a faster 294ps **PicoWay** pulse at 1064nm, despite **PicoWay**'s shorter duration.

## Clearance Rate Comparisons by Ink Color

Head-to-head studies quantify performance across color spectrums:

**Black Ink Professional Tattoos**: **PicoWay** (1064nm) achieves 85-90% clearance in 6-8 sessions. **PicoSure** (755nm) reaches 75-85% in 7-10 sessions. The 1064nm advantage for carbon-based blacks translates to 1-2 fewer sessions on average. Both systems vastly outperform Q-switched alternatives requiring 12-15 sessions.

**Green Ink**: **PicoSure** (755nm) dominates, clearing 80-90% of green pigment in 8-10 sessions. **PicoWay** (1064nm) manages 50-65% in 10-14 sessions. For stubborn greens resistant to previous Q-switched treatments, **PicoSure** remains the clinical standard. Adding **PicoWay** 785nm handpiece improves green response to 65-75% clearance but still trails **PicoSure** 755nm.

**Blue Ink**: **PicoSure** (755nm) and **PicoWay** (1064nm) perform comparably—both achieve 75-85% clearance in 8-11 sessions. Blue pigment absorption spans broad wavelength ranges, allowing either laser to fragment effectively. Technician skill and fluence selection outweigh equipment differences for blue inks.

**Red and Orange Inks**: **PicoWay** (532nm) clears 80-90% in 6-9 sessions. **PicoSure** lacking 532nm handpieces requires referrals to supplemental **Nd:YAG** systems. When **PicoSure** 532nm handpieces are available, performance matches **PicoWay**, though integrated multi-wavelength capability gives **PicoWay** logistical advantages.

**Purple Ink**: Purple combines red and blue pigments, demanding multi-wavelength approaches. **PicoWay** switching between 1064nm and 532nm within sessions achieves 70-80% clearance in 9-12 treatments. **PicoSure** 755nm shows moderate efficacy (60-70% in 10-14 sessions) without complementary wavelengths.

**Yellow Ink**: Both systems struggle with yellows, though **PicoWay** 532nm demonstrates slight advantage. Expected clearance: 50-70% across 12-16 sessions. Yellow pigments (often cadmium or organic azo compounds) resist most laser wavelengths. Neither picosecond system offers dramatic superiority—yellow remains the most recalcitrant color regardless of technology.

## Skin Type and Safety Profiles

Melanin concentration influences wavelength safety:

**Fitzpatrick I-III (Light Skin)**: Both systems perform safely at standard fluences. **PicoSure** 755nm and **PicoWay** 1064nm demonstrate comparable complication rates (3-5% hyperpigmentation, 2-3% hypopigmentation). Technicians select based on ink colors rather than safety differentials on fair skin.

**Fitzpatrick IV-VI (Dark Skin)**: **PicoWay** 1064nm provides superior safety margin. The long wavelength bypasses epidermal melanin, targeting dermal ink with minimal surface absorption. Hyperpigmentation rates remain 5-8% versus 12-18% with **PicoSure** 755nm on Fitzpatrick V-VI skin. The 755nm wavelength competes with melanin for energy absorption, requiring fluence reductions that extend treatment timelines 30-40%.

**Clinical Recommendation**: Dark-skinned patients removing black or blue tattoos should prioritize **PicoWay** 1064nm. Those addressing green ink challenges face trade-offs—**PicoSure** 755nm fragments greens more effectively but demands conservative parameters and longer healing intervals to prevent PIH. Some clinics alternate between systems: **PicoSure** for green components, **PicoWay** for black outlines, managing both efficacy and safety across complex multi-color tattoos.

## Treatment Session Protocols

Procedure approaches differ subtly between platforms:

**Fluence Ranges**: **PicoSure** operates at 2.0-6.0 J/cm² depending on skin type and ink density. **PicoWay** employs 0.3-0.8 J/cm²—dramatically lower numeric values but delivered through smaller spot sizes that concentrate energy density. Direct fluence comparisons mislead; effective treatment parameters depend on spot size, wavelength, and pulse duration interactions.

**Spot Sizes**: **PicoSure** uses 6mm and 8mm spots standard, with 2-4mm options for detail work. **PicoWay** deploys 4mm, 6mm, and 8mm spots. Larger spots cover area faster (reducing treatment duration) while maintaining effective fluence through maintained energy density calculations.

**Pass Counts**: Both systems typically deliver 2-3 passes over treatment areas per session. **PicoWay**'s faster pulse repetition rate (10 Hz vs **PicoSure** 5-10 Hz) reduces procedure duration—treating equivalent tattoos in 8-10 minutes versus 12-15 minutes. Time savings matter primarily for large tattoos where extended treatment duration increases patient discomfort.

**Endpoint Determination**: Technicians treat until whitening (immediate frosting from cavitation bubbles) appears uniformly across tattoo. Both systems generate comparable frosting responses. Over-treatment beyond initial whitening increases complication risks without improving clearance—experienced operators recognize optimal stopping points regardless of platform.

## Cost Comparisons

Equipment acquisition costs influence per-session pricing:

**Equipment Prices**: **PicoSure** systems range $150,000-$190,000 for single-wavelength configurations. Multi-wavelength versions reach $180,000-$220,000. **PicoWay** platforms cost $120,000-$180,000 with multi-wavelength capability standard. Lower **PicoWay** acquisition costs theoretically enable competitive per-session pricing, though market rates remain comparable.

**Per-Session Patient Costs**: Small tattoos cost $250-$450 on either system. Medium pieces range $400-$650. Large tattoos command $600-$900. Geographic location and provider type influence pricing more than equipment brand. Urban dermatology practices charge premiums regardless of laser platform, while suburban medical spas offer competitive rates on both **PicoSure** and **PicoWay** treatments.

**Total Treatment Costs**: Black ink tattoo removal totals $1,800-$5,000 on **PicoWay** versus $2,100-$5,500 on **PicoSure**—differences attributable to 1-2 fewer sessions rather than per-session rate disparities. Multi-color removal costs converge when **PicoSure** clinics refer red ink cases to supplemental providers, adding coordination complexity that may outweigh **PicoWay**'s integrated multi-wavelength convenience.

## Downtime and Healing Differences

Post-treatment recovery timelines remain similar:

**Immediate Response**: Both systems produce petechiae, edema, and frosting that resolve within 30-60 minutes. Patients leave clinics with mild redness and swelling indistinguishable between platforms.

**Blistering Incidence**: Superficial blisters form in 10-15% of treatments on either system. Incidence correlates with fluence aggressiveness and skin thickness rather than laser choice. Proper fluence calibration prevents excessive blistering regardless of platform.

**Re-Epithelialization**: Skin heals completely within 7-10 days on both systems. The 300-450 picosecond pulse difference between **PicoWay** and **PicoSure** generates insufficient thermal variance to alter healing kinetics.

**Inter-Session Intervals**: Both systems demand 6-8 week intervals for lymphatic clearance of fragmented ink. Shorter intervals provide no advantage—immune system processing speed limits removal pace independently of laser technology.

## Provider Availability and Access

Geographic distribution varies between platforms:

**PicoSure Market Presence**: **Cynosure**'s **PicoSure** entered market in 2013, establishing first-mover advantage. Approximately 45-50% of picosecond-equipped clinics in the U.S. operate **PicoSure** systems. Strong presence in metropolitan markets and established dermatology practices.

**PicoWay Market Growth**: **Candela**'s **PicoWay** launched 2015, capturing 40-45% picosecond market share through aggressive clinical marketing and multi-wavelength integration. Growing presence in medical spas and newer laser centers. Particularly dominant in practices emphasizing dark skin treatment due to 1064nm safety profile.

**Geographic Implications**: Patients in major cities access both systems easily. Rural and suburban residents may find only one platform available locally. Verify which system local clinics operate before assuming treatment options—don't pursue **PicoSure** for green ink removal if only **PicoWay** exists within 100 miles.

## Multi-Wavelength Flexibility

Treatment versatility differs significantly:

**PicoWay Advantage**: Integrated 1064nm, 785nm, and 532nm wavelengths within single platforms enable seamless color-specific treatment. Technicians switch handpieces mid-session, addressing black outlines (1064nm), green fills (785nm), and red accents (532nm) without patient rescheduling or facility changes. This integration reduces total treatment timelines by 20-30% for complex multi-color tattoos.

**PicoSure Limitation**: Primary 755nm wavelength necessitates supplemental **Nd:YAG** access for red/orange inks. Patients coordinate appointments across multiple clinics or accept suboptimal 755nm treatment on red components. While **PicoSure** 532nm handpieces exist, most installations remain 755nm-exclusive due to cost constraints and perceived 755nm specialization value.

**Clinical Workflow**: **PicoWay**'s multi-wavelength integration streamlines complex tattoo removal, particularly valuable for patients managing busy schedules. **PicoSure**'s superior green ink performance justifies coordination challenges when greens constitute primary removal obstacle.
