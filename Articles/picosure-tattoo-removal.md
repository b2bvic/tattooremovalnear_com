# PicoSure Tattoo Removal: How It Works, What It Costs, and Who It Helps

**PicoSure** by **Cynosure** (a **Hologic** subsidiary) earned its reputation as the first **FDA**-cleared picosecond aesthetic laser when it launched in 2012. That first-mover status generated massive brand recognition — patients request PicoSure by name more than any other removal platform. But brand recognition and clinical superiority are different things. This guide separates what PicoSure actually delivers from what the marketing implies.

The platform's core strength lies in its 755nm **Alexandrite** wavelength — a frequency that targets green and blue inks with precision that 1064nm systems cannot match. For the right patient and the right tattoo, PicoSure represents a genuinely effective choice. For others, its limitations matter.

## How PicoSure Works

### The 755nm Alexandrite Wavelength

PicoSure's primary beam operates at 755nm, placing it in the near-infrared spectrum. This wavelength was originally developed for the **Alexandrite** laser platform used in hair removal and pigmented lesion treatment. **Cynosure** adapted the technology for tattoo removal by adding picosecond pulse capability.

The 755nm frequency absorbs strongly into green and teal pigments — colors that 1064nm (Nd:YAG) lasers largely miss. Blue-green tattoo inks contain phthalocyanine compounds with peak absorption near 730-755nm, making PicoSure's wavelength a near-ideal match.

**Black ink** also responds to 755nm treatment. Carbon-based black pigments absorb broadly across the spectrum, so the wavelength works — though 1064nm penetrates deeper into the dermis and fragments black ink with more consistent results per session.

**Red, orange, and brown** require PicoSure's optional 532nm handpiece. This frequency-doubled output targets warm-spectrum pigments. Not all PicoSure installations include the 532nm handpiece — verify availability during consultation.

### Picosecond Pulse Duration

PicoSure fires pulses in the 550-750 picosecond range (trillionths of a second). This speed generates photomechanical disruption rather than photothermal destruction — the dominant mechanism in nanosecond Q-Switch systems.

The distinction matters practically. Photomechanical shattering fragments ink particles more completely, producing smaller debris that the lymphatic system clears more efficiently. Less thermal energy reaches surrounding tissue, reducing scarring and hyperpigmentation risk compared to nanosecond alternatives.

However, PicoSure's 550-750 picosecond pulse duration is longer than **PicoWay**'s 294-450 picosecond range. Shorter pulses deliver more concentrated photomechanical force. This specification difference contributes to PicoWay's slightly faster clearance rates in head-to-head comparisons, though clinical outcomes depend heavily on provider technique and patient variables.

For detailed comparison, see [PicoSure vs PicoWay](/articles/picosure-vs-picoway.html).

### The Focus Lens Array

PicoSure's **Focus Lens Array** is a diffractive optical element that redistributes laser energy into a pattern of high-intensity and low-intensity zones across the treatment area. **Cynosure** markets this as **PressureWave** technology.

The Focus Lens Array serves two functions: it intensifies photomechanical disruption at focal points while creating microscopic zones of spared tissue between them. This patterned energy delivery theoretically accelerates healing by preserving tissue architecture between treatment zones.

Clinical data from **Cynosure**-funded studies reports improved clearance rates with the Focus Lens Array versus flat-beam delivery. Independent verification is limited. The technology contributes genuine value — the question is how much versus what the marketing claims.

## PicoSure Session Count Data

### By Tattoo Type

Published clinical data and practitioner-reported ranges for PicoSure:

**Amateur black tattoos (hand-poke, single-needle):** 3-5 sessions
**Professional black tattoos (machine, solid saturation):** 5-8 sessions
**Professional green/blue dominant:** 4-7 sessions (PicoSure's core strength)
**Professional multicolor (requires 532nm handpiece):** 7-10 sessions
**Cover-up preparation (50-70% lightening):** 2-4 sessions
**Dense/layered tattoos:** 8-12+ sessions

These ranges assume 6-8 week spacing between sessions and appropriate patient selection. Individual variation exists based on ink density, depth, immune response, and skin type.

### Comparison to Q-Switch

PicoSure typically requires 25-40% fewer sessions than Q-Switch Nd:YAG for black ink clearance, according to published comparative data. The advantage widens for green and blue inks, where PicoSure's wavelength directly targets the pigment — Q-Switch systems without 755nm capability may never fully clear these colors.

## PicoSure Cost

### Per-Session Pricing

PicoSure per-session costs reflect the platform's brand premium and equipment cost (approximately $150,000-200,000 per unit):

**Small tattoo (2"x2"):** $250-450 per session
**Medium tattoo (4"x4"):** $400-650 per session
**Large tattoo (6"x6"+):** $600-1,000+ per session

These ranges represent national averages. Coastal markets (New York, LA, Miami) trend toward the upper end. Midwest and smaller markets approach the lower end.

### Total Cost Projections

For a medium professional black tattoo:
- **PicoSure:** 6 sessions x $500 average = $3,000 over 9 months
- **Q-Switch:** 9 sessions x $225 average = $2,025 over 15 months

PicoSure costs approximately 48% more in this scenario but completes 6 months faster. The cost-speed tradeoff favors PicoSure when timeline matters more than budget.

For a medium green-dominant tattoo:
- **PicoSure:** 5 sessions x $500 = $2,500 over 8 months
- **Q-Switch (1064nm only, limited green efficacy):** 12+ sessions x $225 = $2,700+ over 20+ months, with likely incomplete green clearance

Here PicoSure delivers both lower total cost and dramatically better outcomes — the 755nm wavelength makes the difference.

## Ideal PicoSure Candidates

### Who Benefits Most

**Green and blue ink dominance:** PicoSure's 755nm wavelength offers the strongest advantage precisely for colors that other platforms struggle with. If your tattoo contains significant green, teal, or blue-green ink, PicoSure delivers results that 1064nm-only systems cannot.

**Lighter skin types (Fitzpatrick I-III):** The 755nm wavelength's melanin absorption is moderate — safe for fair-to-medium skin but riskier for darker tones. Lighter skin patients can tolerate the higher energy settings that maximize clearance per session.

**Timeline-sensitive patients:** PicoSure's reduced session count versus Q-Switch benefits patients with professional deadlines, wedding timelines, or other time-constrained goals.

**Patients near established PicoSure providers:** PicoSure's wide market penetration means experienced providers are available in most metro areas. Provider familiarity with the platform matters — an experienced PicoSure operator outperforms a new PicoWay operator.

### Who Should Consider Alternatives

**Darker skin types (Fitzpatrick IV-VI):** The 755nm wavelength absorbs into melanin, increasing hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation risk. Patients with darker skin should strongly consider **PicoWay** (1064nm picosecond) or Q-Switch Nd:YAG (1064nm nanosecond) as safer alternatives. See [Tattoo Removal for Dark Skin](/articles/tattoo-removal-dark-skin.html).

**Black-only tattoos on fair skin:** For simple black ink removal, PicoSure works but doesn't offer a meaningful advantage over PicoWay 1064nm or even Q-Switch 1064nm. The per-session premium may not be justified when the cheaper technology achieves comparable results.

**Multicolor tattoos with significant red/orange:** PicoSure's 532nm handpiece handles red, but the handpiece is not available at all PicoSure installations. Verify before committing. **PicoWay**'s standard tri-wavelength configuration includes 532nm as default.

**Budget-constrained patients:** If total cost is the deciding factor and timeline flexibility exists, Q-Switch delivers adequate results at 30-40% lower total cost for many tattoo types.

## PicoSure Limitations

### No 1064nm Wavelength

PicoSure's most significant limitation is its lack of a 1064nm option. The 1064nm Nd:YAG wavelength:
- Penetrates deepest into the dermis
- Bypasses melanin absorption most effectively
- Treats Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin most safely
- Addresses deeply embedded black inks

Without 1064nm, PicoSure cannot safely treat darker skin types at full parameters or reach the deepest ink deposits. This is not a marketing distinction — it represents a genuine clinical constraint.

### Wavelength Gaps

PicoSure's two-wavelength configuration (755nm + optional 532nm) leaves coverage gaps compared to three-wavelength platforms. The 700-750nm range — where some blue-green pigments absorb most efficiently — sits slightly below PicoSure's 755nm. **PicoWay**'s 730nm handpiece addresses this gap directly.

### Brand Premium

PicoSure's strong brand recognition translates to price premiums that may exceed its clinical advantage. Patients paying 20-40% more for PicoSure versus **PicoWay** based on name recognition alone are not making an evidence-based decision. Evaluate the technology match for your specific tattoo, not the brand's marketing budget.

## Clinical Research

PicoSure's 2012 FDA clearance (K121541) established the picosecond category. Subsequent studies — primarily funded by **Cynosure** — documented:

- Faster clearance versus Q-Switch for black and blue-green inks
- Lower adverse event rates versus nanosecond systems
- Effective retreatment of Q-Switch-resistant tattoos
- Focus Lens Array improving clearance per session

**Research limitation:** Independent head-to-head comparisons between PicoSure and PicoWay remain limited. Most published data comes from manufacturer-sponsored studies, creating potential bias. Interpret claims of superiority with awareness of funding sources.

The **Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology** and **Lasers in Surgery and Medicine** have published the most rigorous PicoSure clinical data. Ask your provider to reference specific studies if they make efficacy claims.

## Questions to Ask Your PicoSure Provider

1. Does your PicoSure include the 532nm handpiece? (Critical for red/orange inks)
2. When was your PicoSure unit installed? (Systems degrade with use; units older than 5-7 years may have reduced output)
3. How many PicoSure removal patients have you treated? (Experience matters more than the machine)
4. What is your approach for green versus black ink treatment? (Tests wavelength selection knowledge)
5. What Fitzpatrick skin types do you routinely treat with PicoSure? (Identifies experience boundaries)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is PicoSure the best laser for tattoo removal?

PicoSure excels at green and blue ink removal on lighter skin types — it's the best option for that specific combination. For black-only tattoos, multicolor tattoos with significant red/orange, and darker skin types, **PicoWay**'s tri-wavelength platform or Q-Switch 1064nm may deliver equivalent or superior results. "Best" depends entirely on your specific tattoo and skin type.

### How much does PicoSure cost per session?

National averages: $250-450 for small tattoos, $400-650 for medium, $600-1,000+ for large. Pricing varies significantly by market and provider. PicoSure typically commands a 20-40% premium over Q-Switch treatment. Total cost may be comparable to Q-Switch when factoring in the reduced session count.

### Does PicoSure work on all tattoo colors?

PicoSure's 755nm wavelength effectively targets black, dark blue, green, and teal inks. With the optional 532nm handpiece, it also addresses red, orange, and brown. Yellow and white inks remain challenging across all platforms, including PicoSure. The platform lacks a 1064nm wavelength, limiting its deepest-ink and dark-skin capabilities.

### Is PicoSure safe for dark skin?

PicoSure's 755nm wavelength carries elevated risk for Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin types due to melanin absorption. Providers must use conservative energy settings, which extends session counts and may produce incomplete clearance. Patients with darker skin should strongly consider 1064nm platforms (**PicoWay**, Q-Switch Nd:YAG) as safer alternatives.

### How many PicoSure sessions will I need?

Typical ranges: 3-5 sessions for amateur black tattoos, 5-8 for professional black, 4-7 for green/blue dominant, 7-10 for professional multicolor, and 2-4 for cover-up lightening. Individual variation is significant — ink density, depth, your immune response, and provider technique all affect outcomes.
