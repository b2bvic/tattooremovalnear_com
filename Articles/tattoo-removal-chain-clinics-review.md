# Removery vs LaserAway vs Other Chains: Honest Tattoo Removal Comparison

National tattoo removal chains promise standardized quality, transparent pricing, and convenient locations. They deliver on some of these promises better than others. With **Removery** operating 100+ locations, **LaserAway** spanning 80+ locations, and regional chains filling the gaps, chain clinics represent a significant portion of the removal market.

This comparison evaluates the major chains on the factors that actually determine your outcome: technology, practitioner qualifications, treatment protocols, pricing transparency, and documented patient results.

## Removery

**Removery** is the largest tattoo removal-specific chain in North America. Their business model focuses exclusively on tattoo removal — unlike competitors who offer removal alongside other aesthetic services. That specialization shapes their operation.

### Technology

Removery standardizes on **PicoWay** technology across its locations. The **PicoWay** by **Candela** fires the shortest picosecond pulses commercially available (300-450 picoseconds) across three wavelengths (1064nm, 532nm, 785nm).

**Advantage of standardization:** Every Removery location operates the same platform. Your treatment protocol translates across locations without technology adaptation. If you relocate mid-treatment, the receiving location continues with the same laser and comparable parameters.

**Limitation:** Single-platform standardization means Removery doesn't offer Q-Switch treatment for patients who might benefit from it, nor does it offer **PicoSure**'s 755nm alexandrite wavelength, which some practitioners consider superior for specific green ink formulations.

### Practitioner Model

Removery employs trained laser technicians who operate under physician supervision protocols. The supervising physician establishes treatment parameters through written protocols and is available for consultation, but typically does not perform treatments directly.

The technicians complete Removery's internal training program supplemented by **Candela**'s device-specific certification. Clinical backgrounds vary — some technicians are registered nurses, others come from medical assistant or esthetics backgrounds with laser-specific training.

**What this means for you:** The treatment consistency comes from protocol standardization, not individual clinical judgment. This is both the strength (repeatable outcomes) and limitation (less flexibility for unusual cases) of the chain model.

### Pricing

Removery publishes pricing frameworks on their website, though exact per-session costs are confirmed during consultation. General pricing structure:

- Extra small (credit card size or smaller): Starting from $100-200 per session
- Small (palm size): $200-350 per session
- Medium (hand size): $350-550 per session
- Large (8.5x11 paper size): $550-850 per session

Package discounts of 15-25% apply. Removery also offers a "Complete Removal Guarantee" on select packages — if clearance isn't achieved within the package session count, additional sessions are provided at no charge. This guarantee carries specific terms and conditions that merit careful review during consultation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
- Removal specialization (100% of business is tattoo removal)
- Standardized PicoWay technology across all locations
- Package transferability between locations
- Published pricing framework
- Documented community programs (free removal for human trafficking survivors, gang exit programs)

**Weaknesses:**
- Single-technology platform limits flexibility
- Non-physician operators (though under physician protocols)
- Standardized protocols may not optimize for unusual cases
- Corporate structure means individual location quality varies with staff

## LaserAway

**LaserAway** is a broader aesthetic services company that includes tattoo removal alongside laser hair removal, skin rejuvenation, body contouring, and other treatments. Tattoo removal represents a portion of their service mix, not their exclusive focus.

### Technology

LaserAway operates multiple laser platforms depending on the location and treatment type. For tattoo removal, most locations utilize **PicoSure** by **Cynosure** or **PicoWay** by **Candela**. The specific platform varies by location.

**Advantage:** Multi-platform availability means some locations can select the optimal technology for your specific tattoo. A practitioner with access to both **PicoSure** (strong for green/blue) and standard picosecond systems (strong for black/red) can match technology to pigment.

**Limitation:** Platform inconsistency across locations. The PicoSure available at your preferred location may not be available at another if you need to switch.

### Practitioner Model

LaserAway employs registered nurses and physician assistants under physician supervision. Their hiring criteria typically require clinical licensure (RN or PA) with additional laser-specific training.

The clinical background requirement generally exceeds Removery's technician model. However, practitioner experience with tattoo removal specifically varies — a nurse with extensive laser hair removal experience but limited tattoo removal cases operates at a different competency level than one with years of removal-specific practice.

### Pricing

LaserAway's pricing for tattoo removal is determined during consultation. They don't publish removal pricing on their website as openly as Removery. General market positioning:

- Per-session pricing comparable to or slightly above Removery for equivalent tattoo sizes
- Package discounts available (terms vary by location)
- CareCredit and other financing accepted at all locations

### Strengths and Weaknesses

**Strengths:**
- Licensed nurse/PA practitioner model
- Multi-platform technology at some locations
- Extensive location network with evening and weekend hours
- Established brand with significant marketing investment
- **CareCredit** and **Cherry** financing integration

**Weaknesses:**
- Tattoo removal is not their primary business focus
- Pricing opacity (consultation-dependent rather than published)
- Platform variation between locations
- Staff may have more experience with other services (hair removal, injectables) than removal
- Marketing-heavy brand that may overstate outcome timelines

## Regional and Emerging Chains

Several regional chains operate in specific markets.

### Clean Canvas

Operates in select markets with a tattoo removal focus similar to Removery's model. Typically uses picosecond technology with trained technician operators under physician protocols. Smaller scale means fewer locations but potentially more localized quality management.

### Ink-B-Gone

Regional operator in select US markets. Offers removal services at competitive pricing points, often targeting the value segment. Technology and practitioner standards vary by location.

### Dermatology Practice Chains

Large dermatology groups like **Forefront Dermatology** and **US Dermatology Partners** offer tattoo removal at select locations. These differ from pure removal chains by embedding removal within full-scope dermatology practice, with board-certified dermatologists directing care.

**Advantage:** Genuine medical oversight by dermatology specialists.
**Limitation:** Removal may receive less institutional attention than the practice's core dermatology services.

## Patient Experience Differences

The day-to-day experience of treatment at a chain differs from an independent practice in ways that affect long-term satisfaction.

### Consultation Process

**Chain consultations** follow a structured format. You'll receive a tattoo assessment, technology explanation, session estimate, pricing presentation, and financing discussion in a predictable sequence. This consistency makes the experience professional and efficient. The limitation: the structured format may not allow deep dives into your specific concerns or edge cases.

**Independent consultations** vary widely. A board-certified dermatologist may spend 30-45 minutes examining your tattoo with a dermatoscope, discussing your medical history, and explaining physiology. A busy laser clinic may rush through a 10-minute evaluation. The quality ceiling is higher for independents, but the quality floor is lower.

### Treatment Day Experience

**Chain treatment experience:** Check in at reception. Led to a treatment room by a technician or nurse. Treatment performed according to established parameters. Aftercare instructions provided (often printed). Out the door. Total time in clinic: 30-60 minutes including prep.

**Independent treatment experience:** Depends entirely on the practice. A dermatology office may provide a more clinical, medically-oriented experience. A dedicated laser clinic may resemble the chain experience. The variable is the practitioner — their communication style, their willingness to explain what they're observing, and their responsiveness to your questions during treatment.

### Between-Session Support

**Chains** typically provide email or phone support for post-treatment concerns. Some offer patient portals with photo upload capabilities for remote assessment. The support is adequate for routine questions but may not connect you directly with the treating practitioner.

**Independents** may provide more direct access to the treating physician or nurse, particularly smaller practices where the provider has a personal relationship with patients. Direct practitioner access matters most when complications arise and clinical judgment — not protocol — is needed.

### Long-Term Treatment Adjustments

**Chains** adjust treatment parameters according to protocol-driven guidelines. If your tattoo isn't responding as expected, the adjustment follows a decision tree: increase fluence, change spot size, extend interval. This systematic approach works for most cases but may be slow to recognize when a fundamentally different strategy is needed.

**Independents** with experienced practitioners may recognize treatment resistance earlier and pivot strategies — switching wavelengths, adjusting approach, or recommending alternative methods like the [R20 multi-pass technique](/articles/r20-method-tattoo-removal.html) — based on clinical intuition developed over years of practice.

## Reviews and Reputation Analysis

### How to Read Chain Reviews

Online reviews for chain clinics deserve careful interpretation. Patterns to recognize:

**Volume bias:** Chains generate more reviews due to higher patient volume. More reviews produce more moderate average ratings (3.8-4.2 stars) even when service quality is good. A chain at 4.0 stars may deliver equivalent quality to an independent at 4.5 stars.

**Location variance:** Read reviews for your specific location, not the brand overall. Staff quality, management, and patient experience vary between chain locations. A chain with 4.5 stars nationally may have a specific location at 3.5 stars.

**Expectation mismatch complaints:** The most common negative chain reviews cite unmet expectations rather than clinical failures. "It didn't work as fast as they said" or "I needed more sessions than quoted" reflect the industry-wide estimation problem, not chain-specific quality issues.

**Positive review signals:** Look for reviews that mention specific practitioner names, describe clinical competence, note complications handled well, or describe accurate session count predictions. These indicate genuine positive experiences rather than generated or incentivized reviews.

### Independent Provider Review Patterns

Independent providers have fewer reviews. Each review carries more weight — positive or negative. A single 1-star review on a provider with 15 total reviews disproportionately affects their rating compared to the same review among a chain's 500+ reviews.

For both chains and independents, before-and-after portfolios provide more reliable quality evidence than review aggregations. See [How to Vet Tattoo Removal Clinics](/articles/how-to-vet-tattoo-removal-clinics.html) for comprehensive evaluation criteria.

## Chain vs. Independent: The Real Tradeoffs

### Consistency vs. Customization

Chains deliver repeatable experiences through standardized protocols, training, and equipment. You know approximately what to expect at any location.

Independent providers — particularly experienced dermatologists or dedicated removal specialists — offer treatment customized to your specific case. They adjust parameters intuitively based on clinical experience rather than following protocol flowcharts.

**When chain consistency wins:** Straightforward removal cases (black ink, lighter skin, standard size) where the standard protocol handles the situation effectively.

**When independent customization wins:** Complex cases — multicolor tattoos, darker skin types, cover-up layering, resistant inks, medical comorbidities that affect treatment parameters.

### Pricing Transparency

Chains generally offer more predictable pricing than independent providers. Published frameworks, standard package structures, and consistent consultation processes make cost planning easier.

Independents vary more widely. Some offer transparent pricing; others require extended consultations before disclosing cost. The negotiation dynamic also differs — chains have less pricing flexibility per location, while independents (particularly smaller practices) may negotiate on package deals.

### Transfer and Continuity

Chains allow treatment transfer between locations — critical for patients who may relocate during a 12-24 month treatment plan. Your records, treatment parameters, and remaining package sessions transfer with you.

Independent providers don't offer this portability. Switching independents mid-treatment means starting a new clinical relationship, potentially transitioning to different technology, and possibly losing value from prepaid packages.

### Marketing vs. Outcomes

Chain marketing budgets produce polished advertising, prominent Google placement, and social media visibility. This marketing investment doesn't correlate with treatment quality — it correlates with customer acquisition efficiency.

Independent providers with limited marketing budgets may deliver superior outcomes based on practitioner expertise and equipment investment. The clinic with the best Google Ads isn't necessarily the clinic with the best laser. Evaluate based on portfolio evidence, credentials, and technology — not advertising polish.

## Decision Framework

### Choose Removery When:

- You have a straightforward tattoo (black, dark blue, or red ink)
- You value pricing transparency and standardized process
- You might relocate during treatment and need transferability
- You prefer a removal-focused provider rather than a multi-service company
- Your skin type is Fitzpatrick I-III (PicoWay handles all types, but standardized protocols may be less optimized for V-VI)

### Choose LaserAway When:

- Your location options are limited and LaserAway is conveniently located
- You value licensed nurse/PA practitioner credentials
- You plan to combine tattoo removal with other aesthetic services
- The specific LaserAway location has the technology matching your ink colors

### Choose an Independent Provider When:

- Your tattoo presents complexity (multicolor, cover-up layers, resistant ink)
- Your skin type is Fitzpatrick IV-VI and requires expert clinical judgment
- You want a board-certified dermatologist directly involved in your treatment
- Price is less important than individualized clinical assessment
- Your location is stable and portability isn't a concern

### Choose an Academic/Hospital Practice When:

- You have medical complications or contraindications requiring specialist oversight
- Your removal is medically necessary (allergic reaction, MRI interference)
- You need the highest credential standard regardless of cost or convenience
- Your case has failed at a previous provider and requires expert re-evaluation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Removery or LaserAway better for tattoo removal?

Neither is categorically superior. Removery's exclusive focus on tattoo removal and standardized **PicoWay** technology provides removal-specific expertise. LaserAway's licensed practitioner model and multi-platform availability at some locations offers clinical credential advantages. The better choice depends on your specific tattoo, skin type, location, and priorities. For straightforward removal with pricing transparency, Removery has structural advantages. For cases requiring clinical judgment beyond standardized protocols, LaserAway's nurse/PA model may provide a higher clinical floor.

### Are chain tattoo removal clinics safe?

Chains operating under physician supervision with established protocols, standardized technology, and trained staff meet the safety threshold for most patients. Published complication rates from chain providers fall within the general range reported in dermatology literature. The chain model's limitation is handling outlier cases — unusual skin responses, rare complications, atypical tattoo characteristics — where protocol-driven treatment may be insufficient. If your case falls outside standard parameters, a physician-led independent practice provides a safety margin that standardized chain protocols may not.

### Can I transfer my package between chain locations?

Removery explicitly offers package transferability between locations, which is a significant advantage for patients who may relocate. LaserAway's transfer policies vary — confirm transferability during your consultation and get the policy in writing. Regional chains may not offer cross-location transfers. Package transferability matters less if you're confident in your location stability for the 12-24 month treatment duration.

### How do chain clinic prices compare to independent providers?

Chain pricing typically falls in the mid-range — higher than budget independents and lower than premium dermatology practices. For equivalent technology and straightforward treatment, chains and mid-tier independents price similarly. Chain pricing is generally more transparent and predictable, while independent pricing varies more widely and may be negotiable. The total cost comparison depends on session count accuracy — chains' standardized estimates may be less precise than an experienced independent's personalized assessment.

### Can I use chain clinic consultations to compare against independent providers?

Chain consultations (often free) provide useful benchmarks for technology, session estimates, and pricing. Even if you ultimately choose an independent provider, the chain consultation gives you a baseline to evaluate against. Chains' standardized assessment processes produce consistent estimates that serve as a reality check for independent providers' more variable quotations. Use the chain estimate as one data point, not a definitive answer, and compare against at least one independent provider before committing.

### Do chain clinics handle complications well?

Chains manage routine complications (expected blistering, mild hypopigmentation, slow fading) through established protocols. Their supervision physicians are available for escalation. However, complex complications (severe burns, allergic reactions, scarring progression) may exceed the on-site management capability of a technician-staffed chain location. In these situations, the chain's protocol typically directs patients to external medical providers — dermatologists or emergency medicine — rather than managing in-house. An independent dermatology practice manages the same complications directly, maintaining continuity of care through the resolution process.
