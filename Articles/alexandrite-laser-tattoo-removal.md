# Alexandrite Laser for Tattoo Removal: 755nm Wavelength Explained

The **alexandrite laser** operates at **755 nanometers** — a wavelength positioned between ruby (694nm) and Nd:YAG (1064nm) in the laser removal spectrum. This mid-range wavelength gives alexandrite systems a specific performance profile: exceptional absorption by black and blue pigments, reduced efficacy against warm-spectrum colors, and moderate melanin absorption that requires careful skin type screening.

Alexandrite lasers appear in both standalone platforms and as one wavelength option in multiwavelength systems like **PicoSure** and **Enlighten**. Understanding where alexandrite fits in the tattoo removal toolkit helps you evaluate whether a clinic's technology matches your ink characteristics and whether you're a good candidate for this wavelength.

## How Alexandrite Wavelength Targets Tattoo Ink

Laser wavelengths interact with chromophores — substances that absorb specific light frequencies. Tattoo removal depends on selective photothermolysis: the laser wavelength must be absorbed preferentially by ink particles rather than surrounding tissue.

### The 755nm Sweet Spot

At **755nm**, alexandrite wavelength sits between the melanin absorption peak (shorter wavelengths around 694nm) and the water absorption range (longer wavelengths above 1400nm). This positioning creates performance characteristics:

**Strong absorption by dark pigments.** Black carbon-based ink and blue pigments absorb 755nm light efficiently. The energy converts to heat, fragmenting ink particles into smaller pieces that lymphatic drainage can remove.

**Moderate melanin absorption.** Melanin — the pigment in skin that creates skin tone — absorbs 755nm moderately well. This absorption creates a treatment ceiling for darker skin types. Too much energy at 755nm in melanin-rich skin causes burns or pigmentation changes.

**Minimal absorption by red and yellow.** Warm-spectrum tattoo colors reflect 755nm wavelength rather than absorbing it. Alexandrite shows poor performance on red, orange, and yellow ink. These colors require longer wavelengths like **1064nm Nd:YAG** for effective treatment.

### Alexandrite in Picosecond vs Nanosecond Platforms

The pulse duration — how long each laser burst fires — affects how the wavelength performs.

**Nanosecond alexandrite** systems fire pulses measured in billionths of a second. These systems have been used for tattoo removal since the 1990s. They fragment ink through photothermal effect: heat buildup causes the particle to shatter.

**Picosecond alexandrite** systems like the **PicoSure** fire pulses measured in trillionths of a second — 1,000 times faster than nanosecond systems. This speed creates a photoacoustic rather than purely photothermal effect. The rapid energy delivery creates a pressure wave that shatters ink particles with less collateral heat damage to surrounding tissue.

For detailed comparison of pulse durations, see [Nanosecond vs Picosecond Lasers for Tattoo Removal](nanosecond-vs-picosecond-lasers.html).

## What Alexandrite Laser Treats Best

Alexandrite wavelength excels in specific scenarios and struggles in others. Proper treatment planning matches wavelength to ink characteristics.

### Ideal Candidates for Alexandrite Treatment

**Black ink tattoos on light skin.** A simple black tribal tattoo on Fitzpatrick I-III skin represents the ideal alexandrite case. The wavelength fragments black ink efficiently without competing melanin absorption from darker skin.

**Blue ink removal.** Blue pigments — particularly royal blue and navy shades — respond exceptionally well to 755nm. Alexandrite may outperform longer wavelengths on these colors.

**Amateur tattoos.** Homemade stick-and-poke tattoos typically use simpler ink formulations and sit at shallower dermal depths than professional work. The combination makes them more responsive to alexandrite treatment. Many amateur tattoos contain only black ink, playing to alexandrite's strengths.

**Small decorative pieces.** Delicate line work, fine script, and small symbols benefit from the precision available with alexandrite systems, especially picosecond platforms that minimize surrounding tissue damage.

### What Alexandrite Struggles With

**Multicolor tattoos.** Any tattoo containing red, orange, yellow, or green requires wavelengths beyond alexandrite's capability. A sleeve with color variation needs a multiwavelength approach. See [Multicolor Tattoo Removal: Wavelength Strategy](multicolor-tattoo-removal.html).

**Dark skin tones.** Fitzpatrick types IV-VI carry melanin concentrations that compete with ink for 755nm absorption. Aggressive alexandrite treatment on darker skin produces burns and dyspigmentation. These patients typically require **1064nm Nd:YAG** wavelength, which penetrates deeper with less melanin interaction.

**Dense professional ink.** Professional tattoo artists use saturated, complex ink formulations layered throughout the dermis. While alexandrite can eventually clear these tattoos, the density and depth often make longer wavelengths more efficient for initial sessions.

**Deep blowout ink.** Ink that has migrated beyond the intended tattoo boundary — creating a blurred halo effect — sits at depths where alexandrite penetration becomes less effective. Longer wavelengths reach these deep particles more efficiently.

## Session Expectations with Alexandrite Laser

Treatment outcomes depend on the specific alexandrite platform, operator skill, and tattoo characteristics. General patterns emerge from clinical data.

### Treatment Timeline

**Amateur black tattoos:** 3-6 sessions, spaced 6-8 weeks apart. Light amateur work may show substantial fading after 2 sessions.

**Professional black tattoos:** 8-12 sessions for complete removal, 4-6 sessions for cover-up preparation. Professional ink density requires more total fragmentation work.

**Blue ink removal:** 6-10 sessions depending on saturation. Blue clears faster than green or purple but slower than basic black.

**Multicolor removal:** Not achievable with alexandrite alone. The treatment timeline depends on the multiwavelength system being used.

### Per-Session Response

First session typically produces **20-30% visible fading** in responsive tattoos — primarily amateur black work on light skin. Professional tattoos may show less dramatic first-session response due to ink density.

Progressive sessions show diminishing returns. Early sessions produce visible fading. Later sessions target increasingly small residual particles, making progress less apparent between treatments.

### Pain Profile

Alexandrite laser pain varies with pulse duration and cooling systems.

**Nanosecond systems** deliver heat that patients describe as snapping rubber bands repeatedly against skin. The thermal sensation builds during the session.

**Picosecond systems** produce a sharper, more percussive sensation — less thermal burn, more mechanical impact. Many patients report picosecond alexandrite as less uncomfortable than nanosecond platforms.

Cooling systems — **Zimmer Cryo** chillers, cold air devices, or contact cooling tips — reduce discomfort substantially. Pain remains manageable for most patients without prescription numbing, though topical **lidocaine** cream helps with sensitive areas.

## Alexandrite vs Other Wavelengths for Black Ink

Black ink absorbs across a wide wavelength spectrum, making it treatable with multiple laser types. Performance differences emerge in efficiency and skin type compatibility.

### Alexandrite (755nm) vs Nd:YAG (1064nm)

Both wavelengths fragment black ink effectively. The choice depends on skin tone and tattoo depth.

**Alexandrite advantages:**
- Faster fragmentation per session for superficial ink
- Better precision for fine line work
- Stronger absorption by blue tones

**Nd:YAG advantages:**
- Safe for all skin types (minimal melanin absorption)
- Better deep penetration for buried ink
- Can treat all colors in multicolor tattoos (1064nm handles black, 532nm frequency-doubled output handles red)

For light-skinned patients with superficial black tattoos, alexandrite may produce faster initial results. For dark-skinned patients or deep ink, **Nd:YAG** becomes the safer, more effective option.

### Alexandrite (755nm) vs Ruby (694nm)

**Ruby lasers** operate at 694nm — shorter wavelength than alexandrite. This wavelength shows even stronger melanin absorption, making ruby systems unsuitable for skin types beyond Fitzpatrick II.

Ruby fell out of favor for tattoo removal as safer alternatives emerged. Modern clinics rarely use ruby systems. Alexandrite replaced ruby in most applications because it offers similar black ink performance with better skin type tolerance.

### Why Clinics Combine Wavelengths

Multiwavelength platforms like **PicoSure** (755nm + 532nm), **Enlighten** (755nm + 1064nm + 532nm), and **PicoWay** (1064nm + 532nm + 785nm) recognize that no single wavelength optimally treats all tattoo colors and skin types.

A clinic offering only alexandrite wavelength can treat simple black and blue tattoos on light skin. A clinic with multiwavelength systems can treat any tattoo on any skin type. The equipment investment reflects this versatility — expect to pay more for treatment at clinics using comprehensive wavelength platforms.

## Skin Type Considerations for Alexandrite Treatment

The **Fitzpatrick Scale** classifies skin types from I (very fair, always burns) to VI (deeply pigmented, never burns). Melanin content increases with Fitzpatrick number, affecting safe laser parameters.

### Safe Fitzpatrick Range for Alexandrite

**Types I-III:** Ideal candidates. Minimal melanin competition allows aggressive energy delivery for faster results.

**Type IV:** Treatable with caution. Conservative energy settings and test patches prevent burns. Treatment takes longer but remains safe when properly executed.

**Types V-VI:** Generally avoided with alexandrite wavelength. Melanin absorption risk outweighs benefit. These patients should receive **1064nm Nd:YAG** treatment instead.

### Test Patches for Borderline Cases

Responsible clinics perform test patches on Fitzpatrick III-IV patients before full treatment. The test fires the laser at a small tattoo section using proposed treatment parameters. The patient returns 7-10 days later for assessment.

Test patch evaluation looks for:
- Appropriate blistering (resolves within 10-14 days)
- Absence of burns or skin texture changes
- No hyper- or hypopigmentation
- Visible ink fading

Positive test results confirm safe parameters for full treatment. Adverse reactions prompt parameter adjustment or wavelength change.

## Alexandrite in Popular Tattoo Removal Platforms

Several commercial platforms use alexandrite wavelength, each with proprietary features affecting performance.

### PicoSure (Cynosure)

The **PicoSure** was the first FDA-cleared picosecond laser for tattoo removal. It operates at **755nm** with **750 picosecond** pulse duration.

**Key features:**
- **Focus lens array** — optional handpiece attachment that creates high-pressure zones for stubborn ink
- Primarily designed for black, blue, and green pigments
- Often paired with **532nm** handpiece for red ink
- Became the picosecond standard after 2013 FDA clearance

PicoSure's 755nm wavelength remains its core strength for dark ink removal. The platform's market dominance means many clinics advertise "PicoSure removal" when they specifically mean picosecond alexandrite treatment.

For detailed platform analysis, see [PicoSure Tattoo Removal: Is It Worth the Premium?](picosure-tattoo-removal.html).

### Enlighten (Cutera)

**Enlighten** offers dual wavelength capability: **1064nm** and **755nm**, both at picosecond speeds (750ps and 660ps respectively).

This combination handles a wider color range than PicoSure's alexandrite-focused design. The 1064nm wavelength treats red and reaches deep ink, while 755nm optimizes black and blue removal.

**Enlighten III** added a **532nm** nanosecond wavelength for even broader color coverage. This makes Enlighten platforms true multicolor systems rather than alexandrite-focused units.

### RevLite and Other Q-Switch Alexandrite Systems

Before picosecond lasers dominated, several **Q-Switch nanosecond** platforms offered 755nm wavelength:

- **RevLite SI** (Cynosure) — 755nm option alongside 1064nm and 532nm
- **MedLite C6** (Hoya ConBio) — similar multiwavelength configuration

These nanosecond systems still treat tattoos effectively, particularly simple black ink. They cost significantly less than picosecond platforms, making them common in budget-conscious clinics.

Performance differences between nanosecond and picosecond alexandrite matter most for difficult tattoos — multicolor professional work, resistant pigments, and scar tissue treatment. For basic black amateur tattoos, nanosecond alexandrite performs adequately at lower cost.

## Treatment Protocol and Safety Parameters

Proper alexandrite laser treatment follows specific protocols to maximize results while minimizing complications.

### Energy Density (Fluence)

Fluence measures energy per unit area, expressed in **joules per square centimeter (J/cm²)**. Higher fluence delivers more ink-fragmenting power but increases burn risk.

**Typical alexandrite fluence ranges:**
- Fitzpatrick I-II: 3.5-5.0 J/cm²
- Fitzpatrick III: 2.5-4.0 J/cm²
- Fitzpatrick IV: 2.0-3.5 J²/cm² (conservative)

Operators increase fluence across treatment sessions as ink density decreases. The first session uses conservative settings. Later sessions can safely increase energy as less ink remains to absorb heat.

### Spot Size

Spot size — the diameter of the laser beam — affects penetration depth and energy distribution. Larger spot sizes penetrate deeper and distribute energy more evenly. Smaller spots provide precision for detailed work.

**Alexandrite spot sizes:**
- 2-4mm: Fine line work, small tattoos
- 6-8mm: Standard treatment areas
- 10mm: Large coverage zones

### Pulse Repetition Rate

Some alexandrite platforms fire multiple pulses per second, affecting treatment speed and heat accumulation.

**Single-pulse mode:** The operator fires individual pulses with deliberate spacing. This approach gives maximum control and minimizes heat buildup but takes longer.

**Repetition mode:** The laser fires continuously while the handpiece moves across the tattoo. This speeds treatment but requires expert technique to maintain proper overlap without excessive heat accumulation.

### Cooling and Anesthesia

Epidermal cooling protects the skin surface while allowing the laser to target dermal ink. Common cooling methods:

**Contact cooling:** The laser handpiece includes a chilled tip that touches skin during treatment. Maintains consistent cooling but limits treatment speed.

**Cold air systems:** Devices like **Zimmer Cryo** blow -30°C air across the treatment zone. Allows faster handpiece movement but produces less cooling than contact methods.

**Cryogen spray:** Immediately before each pulse, the system sprays a brief burst of cryogen coolant. Provides strong cooling but adds complexity and cost.

Most patients tolerate alexandrite treatment with cooling alone. Particularly sensitive areas (ribs, feet, hands) may benefit from topical **lidocaine 4-5%** cream applied 30-60 minutes before treatment.

## Combination Therapy: Alexandrite + Other Wavelengths

Most modern tattoo removal involves wavelength switching based on ink color and treatment response.

### Sequential Wavelength Strategy

A multicolor tattoo might receive:

**Session 1:** 755nm alexandrite for black and blue areas + 532nm for red areas

**Session 2-4:** Continued multiwavelength treatment as all colors fade

**Session 5+:** Predominantly 1064nm for deep residual ink that survived initial treatment

This sequential approach uses each wavelength where it performs best, accelerating total treatment timeline.

### Simultaneous Treatment

Some advanced protocols treat different tattoo sections with different wavelengths in the same session. A sleeve with distinct color zones might receive 755nm on the black shading, 1064nm on deep green areas, and 532nm on red highlights — all within a 30-minute appointment.

This requires multiwavelength platforms and experienced operators who understand color-wavelength matching. Done properly, it reduces total sessions by treating all colors concurrently rather than waiting for one color to clear before addressing others.

## Cost Implications of Alexandrite Treatment

Alexandrite laser treatment pricing varies with platform technology and clinic positioning.

### Picosecond Alexandrite Premium

Clinics with **PicoSure** or **Enlighten** systems typically charge premium rates:

**Small tattoo** (2-4 inches): $200-400 per session
**Medium tattoo** (4-8 inches): $400-800 per session
**Large tattoo** (8+ inches): $800-1,500 per session

The premium reflects equipment cost (picosecond lasers cost $200,000-400,000), marketing positioning, and potentially faster clearance for responsive tattoos.

### Q-Switch Alexandrite Economy

Clinics using older **Q-Switch nanosecond** alexandrite systems charge less:

**Small tattoo:** $100-250 per session
**Medium tattoo:** $250-500 per session
**Large tattoo:** $500-1,000 per session

For simple black tattoos on light skin, the Q-Switch discount may make financial sense. Session count differences between nanosecond and picosecond systems — typically 1-3 additional sessions with nanosecond platforms — may not offset the per-session savings.

### Wavelength Switching Fees

Some clinics charge additional fees when treatment requires multiple wavelengths in a single session. Expect $50-150 surcharges for multiwavelength treatment. Clinics with flat-rate pricing regardless of wavelength complexity offer better value for multicolor work.

## When to Choose Alexandrite vs Other Laser Types

Strategic wavelength selection optimizes results and cost-efficiency.

### Choose Alexandrite-Focused Treatment When:

**You have simple black or blue ink on light skin.** This scenario plays to alexandrite's core strength. No need to pay for multiwavelength capability you won't use.

**You want faster initial results.** Alexandrite's strong absorption by dark pigments can produce dramatic early fading that motivates continued treatment.

**Your tattoo is amateur or stick-and-poke.** These less complex tattoos clear efficiently with alexandrite alone.

**You need precision for delicate work.** Small fonts, fine lines, and detailed shading benefit from alexandrite's accuracy, especially on picosecond platforms.

### Choose Multiwavelength Systems When:

**Your tattoo contains red, orange, yellow, or green.** Alexandrite alone cannot clear warm-spectrum colors. You need **532nm** or **1064nm** in addition to alexandrite. For color strategy details, see [Multicolor Tattoo Removal: Wavelength Strategy](multicolor-tattoo-removal.html).

**You have Fitzpatrick type IV or darker.** Safety requires **1064nm** for minimal melanin interaction, even if your tattoo is black.

**Your tattoo is dense professional work.** Deep, saturated professional ink benefits from wavelength flexibility to target different ink depths and particle sizes across treatment progression.

**You want maximum versatility.** Multiwavelength platforms adapt to unexpected ink behavior. If your black ink proves resistant to alexandrite (rare but possible), the operator can switch to 1064nm without referring you elsewhere.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can alexandrite laser remove all tattoo colors?

No. Alexandrite excels at black and blue but cannot effectively treat red, orange, yellow, or green. These warm-spectrum colors require shorter wavelengths (532nm for red/orange) or longer wavelengths with specific absorption characteristics (1064nm for green). Any clinic claiming alexandrite alone removes all colors is misrepresenting the technology.

### Is alexandrite laser safe for dark skin?

Alexandrite carries higher risk for Fitzpatrick types IV-VI due to melanin absorption. Conservative treatment of type IV skin is possible with experienced operators, test patches, and reduced energy settings. Types V-VI should not receive alexandrite treatment — 1064nm Nd:YAG provides safe black ink removal without dyspigmentation risk.

### Does picosecond alexandrite work better than nanosecond for all tattoos?

Picosecond shows advantages for difficult tattoos — multicolor professional work, resistant pigments, tattoos over scar tissue, and partial removal for cover-up preparation. For simple amateur black tattoos on ideal-candidate skin, nanosecond alexandrite performs adequately. The picosecond premium matters most when treating complex cases.

### How long do I wait between alexandrite laser sessions?

Standard interval is **6-8 weeks**. This allows complete healing, immune system processing of fragmented ink, and accurate assessment of treatment response. Some protocols extend to 10-12 weeks between later sessions when ink density is low and the body needs more time to clear remaining particles. Rushing sessions closer together doesn't accelerate total timeline and may increase complication risk.

### Can I switch from alexandrite to a different wavelength mid-treatment?

Yes. If your tattoo responds poorly to alexandrite or you experience adverse reactions, the clinic can switch to a different wavelength for remaining sessions. This assumes they have multiwavelength equipment. Single-wavelength clinics would need to refer you elsewhere. This is one argument for starting treatment at a facility with comprehensive wavelength options rather than alexandrite-only systems.

### Will alexandrite laser treatment leave scars?

When performed correctly with appropriate parameters for your skin type, alexandrite laser creates minimal scarring risk. Blistering is normal and resolves without scarring in most cases. Scarring occurs from operator error (excessive energy), patient factors (history of keloid formation, inadequate aftercare), or treating inappropriate candidates (recent sun exposure, active skin conditions). Choose experienced operators and follow aftercare instructions to minimize risk.

### Does insurance cover alexandrite laser tattoo removal?

Cosmetic tattoo removal rarely receives insurance coverage. Traumatic tattoos (ink embedded during injury), gang-affiliation tattoos removed for employment or safety, and some cases of allergic reaction to tattoo ink may qualify for coverage. You need pre-authorization and medical necessity documentation. Even qualifying cases may face claim denials requiring appeals. Assume out-of-pocket cost unless you've confirmed coverage in writing.
