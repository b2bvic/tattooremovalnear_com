# Tattoo Removal New Orleans LA: Clinics, Costs, and Complete Guide

New Orleans offers 10+ specialized tattoo removal clinics across French Quarter, Uptown, Metairie, and surrounding areas using **PicoWay**, **Enlighten**, and **Q-switched Nd:YAG** lasers. Session costs range from $175 to $525 depending on tattoo size and technology, with most patients completing removal in 6-12 treatments spaced 8-10 weeks apart.

## Leading New Orleans Tattoo Removal Providers

**Removery New Orleans** operates locations in Metairie on Veterans Memorial Boulevard and Uptown on Magazine Street. Both use **Astanza Trinity** lasers combining Q-switched and picosecond wavelengths (1064nm, 532nm, 694nm). Certified technicians provide complimentary consultations with Kirby-Desai scoring. Small tattoos cost $200 per session, medium pieces run $325-$425, large work reaches $525.

**New Orleans Dermatology & Cosmetic** in Uptown features board-certified dermatologists using **Candela PicoWay** devices. Sessions cost $250-$500. They accept CareCredit and offer Tulane University employee discounts.

**Louisiana Laser & Skin Care** maintains locations in Metairie and Slidell using **Cynosure PicoSure** lasers. Six-session packages cost $1,425 on small tattoos (normally $250 each). Complimentary numbing cream included.

**NOLA Laser & Aesthetics** in Mid-City uses **Spectra** Q-switched lasers at budget pricing ($150-$350 per session). Best for simple black tattoos.

**Ochsner Dermatology** in Jefferson Parish specializes in complex cases using **Enlighten III** systems. Premium pricing ($300-$550 per session) reflects medical center expertise.

## New Orleans Cost Structure

French Quarter and Uptown locations charge 12-18% premiums over suburban areas due to tourism infrastructure costs. Small tattoos average $175-$250 at budget clinics and $225-$300 at dermatology practices. Medium tattoos run $300-$475. Half-sleeves cost $425-$550 per session, with 8-12 treatments needed ($3,400-$6,600 total).

Color complexity drives costs. Faded black tattoos clear in 5-6 sessions ($875-$1,500), multicolor pieces demand 10-14 treatments ($3,500-$7,700). Package deals dominate—**Removery** bundles 6 treatments at $1,200 for small tattoos.

**Tourism industry discounts** reflect hospitality economy—several clinics offer 10-15% off to hotel, restaurant, and French Quarter employees with visible tattoos affecting employment standards.

## Treatment Process and Pain Management

Consultations assess Fitzpatrick skin type (critical in New Orleans's 60% African American population), ink depth, and expectations. **Wood's lamp** examination detects metallic pigments. **Q-switched lasers** emit 5-10 nanosecond pulses at 1064nm for black, 532nm for reds. **Picosecond lasers** deliver 450-750 picosecond pulses creating photoacoustic shockwaves.

Pain management includes topical **lidocaine 5%** cream and **Zimmer Cryo** cooling. **New Orleans Dermatology** offers **Pro-Nox** nitrous oxide at $75-$125 additional. Injectable lidocaine available for large tattoos, adding $100-$200. Aftercare involves antibiotic ointment and dressings for 72 hours.

## Louisiana Regulations and Licensing

**Louisiana Revised Statutes 37:1270** requires laser operators to work under physician supervision or hold APRN licenses with laser training. The **Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners** mandates 40 hours education and 20 supervised procedures. Facilities register devices with **Louisiana Department of Health** and maintain liability insurance.

## Session Frequency and Timeline

New Orleans practitioners space treatments 8-12 weeks apart. Black ink clears in 6-8 sessions over 12-18 months. Resistant colors require 10-14 treatments spanning 20-28 months. The **Kirby-Desai Scale** predicts counts using skin type, location, colors, density, scarring, and layering.

## Louisiana Climate Impact

New Orleans's extreme humidity (75-85% average, highest in major U.S. cities) significantly affects healing. High humidity increases lymphatic fluid retention, paradoxically slowing ink clearance despite elevated immune activity. Schedule treatments during winter (December-February, average 50-65°F and 65-75% humidity) for optimal results.

**Hurricane season** (June-November) creates planning challenges. Avoid scheduling treatments during peak season (August-October) when evacuations disrupt follow-up care. Post-storm flooding elevates infection risks if treating during recovery periods.

Summer UV radiation (UV index 9-11) demands strict photoprotection 4-6 weeks post-treatment. Failure causes hyperpigmentation in New Orleans's predominantly African American population. Mineral sunscreens at SPF 50+ essential.

**Mardi Gras season** (January-February) brings elevated alcohol consumption and outdoor activities complicating healing. Schedule treatments after Mardi Gras or well before (October-November) to avoid conflicts.

## Darker Skin Type Expertise

New Orleans's 60% African American population demands expertise treating Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin. **New Orleans Dermatology**, **Ochsner Dermatology**, and **Louisiana Laser** maintain published protocols for darker skin. They start conservative fluences (2-3 J/cm²) and gradually increase. Test spots assess response before treating entire tattoos.

**1064nm wavelength preference** for darker skin due to reduced melanin absorption. Extended intervals (10-14 weeks versus 8-10) allow complete inflammation resolution, reducing hypopigmentation risk.

## Comparing Technologies

**Q-switched lasers** dominate budget clinics with proven efficacy. **Picosecond lasers** charge $50-$100 more per session but reduce total sessions 20-40%. **Combination systems** like **Astanza Trinity** at **Removery** handle multicolor efficiently. **Fractional lasers** available only at **Ochsner Dermatology** at $325-$575/session.

## Payment Options

**CareCredit** offers $500-$25,000 limits with 0% APR promotional periods. **Cherry** financing provides point-of-sale loans 0-29.99% APR. **Hancock Whitney Bank** (Louisiana-based) offers personal loans 7-16% APR for local residents. **In-house plans** require 25-35% down, 6-12 month terms at 0-12% interest.

## Special Populations

**Tulane students and employees** receive 10% discounts at **New Orleans Dermatology** with Tulane ID. **Tourism and hospitality workers** receive 10-15% off at select clinics recognizing visible tattoo restrictions in French Quarter establishments. **Ochsner Health System employees** receive discounts at **Ochsner Dermatology**.

Schedule treatments during winter (December-February) or spring (March-May) to avoid conflicts. If treating during hurricane season, ensure aftercare supplies (antibiotic ointment, dressings, wound wash) are included in evacuation kit.
