# Cutera Enlighten III Laser Review: Specs, Effectiveness, and Clinic Availability

The **Enlighten III** by **Cutera** is the only tattoo removal laser that fires both picosecond and nanosecond pulses across three wavelengths from a single platform. That triple-wavelength, dual-pulse architecture makes it one of the most versatile systems in clinical use today, capable of addressing the full spectrum of tattoo ink colors without switching devices.

If your clinic uses an **Enlighten III**, you have access to technology that competes directly with **PicoSure** and **PicoWay** while offering flexibility neither platform matches alone. Here's what that means for your removal outcomes.

## What Makes the Enlighten III Different

Most tattoo removal lasers specialize. **PicoSure** by **Cynosure** dominates at the 755nm wavelength for greens and blues. **PicoWay** by **Candela** covers broad wavelength range with ultra-short pulses. The **Enlighten III** carves its niche by combining capabilities that typically require two separate machines.

### Three Wavelengths, One Device

The Enlighten III delivers energy at three distinct wavelengths:

**1064nm (Nd:YAG fundamental):** The workhorse for black and dark blue ink. This wavelength penetrates deep into the dermis and targets carbon-based pigments without significant absorption by melanin. Safe across all Fitzpatrick skin types, including darker complexions where melanin interference poses risk with shorter wavelengths.

**532nm (Nd:YAG frequency-doubled):** Targets red, orange, and warm-toned inks. The frequency-doubling process halves the wavelength, shifting absorption into the red pigment spectrum. Effective against iron oxide-based reds and most orange formulations.

**670nm (added in the III revision):** This wavelength specifically addresses blue and green pigments that fall between the 532nm and 1064nm absorption windows. Before the III model, Cutera's Enlighten line lacked an effective answer for stubborn greens. The 670nm handpiece closed that gap. Green phthalocyanine-based inks and cerulean blues absorb efficiently at this wavelength.

The three wavelengths together cover approximately 95% of commercially available tattoo ink pigments. Yellow and white remain problematic across all platforms, including the Enlighten III, due to their reflective properties and paradoxical darkening response.

### Dual Pulse Modes

Where competitors commit to one pulse duration, the Enlighten III switches between picosecond and nanosecond modes.

**Picosecond mode (750 picoseconds):** Generates photomechanical disruption. Ink particles shatter from pressure waves rather than heat accumulation. Less thermal damage to surrounding tissue. More complete particle fragmentation per pulse. This mode drives faster clearance and lower complication rates, particularly for dense professional tattoos.

**Nanosecond mode (2 nanoseconds):** Produces photothermal ablation. Longer pulse duration delivers more thermal energy to ink deposits. Useful for particularly resistant inks, deep deposits, and situations where the photomechanical approach hasn't generated adequate fragmentation. Some practitioners prefer nanosecond pulses for initial sessions on dense cover-up tattoos where maximum energy delivery outweighs finesse.

The practitioner selects the mode based on your tattoo's characteristics and treatment stage. Early sessions might use nanosecond mode to break apart large particle clusters, then transition to picosecond mode for refinement as particles shrink. This staged approach is unique to dual-pulse platforms.

## Clinical Performance Data

Marketing claims need clinical backing. The Enlighten III has accumulated a meaningful research record since **Cutera** introduced the platform.

### Published Efficacy Rates

A 2022 study published in the **Journal of Cosmetic and Laser Therapy** documented the Enlighten III achieving 75% or greater clearance in 82% of participants within 8 sessions. The study population included professional multicolor tattoos across Fitzpatrick skin types I through V.

Comparative data from the **Lasers in Surgery and Medicine** journal showed the Enlighten III's 670nm wavelength clearing green ink at rates comparable to the **PicoSure**'s 755nm alexandrite approach, with marginally fewer reported adverse events. The sample size was modest (47 participants), but the direction of the data favors the Enlighten III for green ink treatment in darker skin types.

Black ink clearance rates mirror the broader picosecond category. The 1064nm picosecond mode achieves measurable fading of 50-60% after 3 sessions for most professional black tattoos. Complete clearance typically requires 6-10 sessions, consistent with **PicoWay** and **PicoSure** outcomes for equivalent tattoos.

### Real-World Session Counts

Clinical trials operate under controlled conditions. Real-world results show more variance. Based on published practitioner data and clinic reporting:

**Amateur black tattoos:** 3-6 sessions for 90%+ clearance. The shallow ink depth and lower pigment density respond rapidly to picosecond pulses at 1064nm.

**Professional black tattoos:** 6-10 sessions. Dense, uniformly deposited ink requires more passes. Nanosecond mode may be employed for initial sessions on heavily saturated areas.

**Professional multicolor tattoos:** 8-14 sessions. Each color requires wavelength-specific treatment. Sessions may address different regions of a multicolor piece with different handpieces, extending treatment time per visit.

**Cover-up tattoos (layered ink):** 10-16 sessions. Multiple ink layers compound the challenge. The Enlighten III's dual-pulse capability provides an advantage here, using nanosecond mode to break through dense upper layers before picosecond pulses refine clearance.

These session counts assume 6-8 week intervals between treatments. Total timeline ranges from 4 months (simple amateur tattoo) to over 2 years (complex cover-up removal).

### Comparison Against Competitors

The Enlighten III operates in a three-way competitive field with **PicoSure** and **PicoWay**.

**Versus PicoSure:** The **PicoSure** uses a 755nm alexandrite laser, making it the gold standard for green and blue ink removal. The Enlighten III's 670nm wavelength addresses similar pigments but through a different absorption pathway. PicoSure fires shorter pulses (550-750 picoseconds) and has a longer track record with **FDA** clearance dating to 2012. The Enlighten III offers broader wavelength coverage from a single platform, potentially reducing the need for clinics to maintain multiple laser systems.

**Versus PicoWay:** **Candela**'s **PicoWay** fires the shortest pulses in the category (300-450 picoseconds across wavelengths). Shorter pulses mean more photomechanical force and potentially fewer sessions for certain tattoos. The PicoWay covers 1064nm, 532nm, and 785nm wavelengths. The Enlighten III counters with its unique nanosecond fallback mode, which the PicoWay lacks entirely.

**Versus Q-Switch systems:** The Enlighten III outperforms nanosecond-only systems across virtually every clinical metric. Faster clearance, fewer sessions, lower adverse event rates, better color coverage. The only scenario favoring a standalone Q-Switch is budget — clinics using older equipment charge less per session.

## Safety Profile and FDA Clearance

**Cutera** received **FDA** 510(k) clearance for the Enlighten system for tattoo removal. The clearance covers all three wavelengths in both pulse modes. The **FDA** clearance process for laser devices evaluates safety and substantial equivalence to previously cleared devices rather than conducting independent clinical trials.

### Side Effect Profile

Common side effects mirror other picosecond platforms:

**Expected responses (resolve within 2 weeks):** Erythema (redness), edema (swelling), pinpoint bleeding, blistering, temporary hyperpigmentation. These indicate the laser achieved sufficient energy delivery to fragment ink particles.

**Uncommon complications (< 5% incidence):** Prolonged hypopigmentation, textural changes, incomplete fading plateaus. Risk increases with darker skin types and aggressive treatment parameters.

**Rare complications (< 1% incidence):** Scarring, permanent pigmentation changes, allergic reactions to fragmented ink components entering the lymphatic system. Proper technique and conservative energy settings minimize these outcomes.

The Enlighten III's ability to switch from picosecond to nanosecond mode introduces a safety consideration: nanosecond pulses generate more heat. Practitioners must select the appropriate mode for each patient's skin type and treatment stage. The additional flexibility creates an additional decision point where clinician expertise matters.

### Skin Type Considerations

The 1064nm wavelength at picosecond speed is the safest option for Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin types. Melanin absorption at this wavelength is minimal, reducing burns and dyspigmentation risk. The Enlighten III shares this safety advantage with the **PicoWay**.

The 532nm wavelength carries higher risk for darker skin. Melanin competes with red ink pigment for photon absorption. Conservative fluence settings and extended intervals between sessions mitigate this risk but extend timelines.

The 670nm wavelength occupies a middle ground. Less melanin interference than 532nm but more than 1064nm. Practitioners treating darker skin should use test patches before committing to treatment protocols involving this wavelength.

## Finding Clinics With the Enlighten III

The Enlighten III's versatility hasn't translated to ubiquitous availability. **Cutera** positions the system as a premium platform, and its price point (approximately $150,000-200,000 per unit) limits adoption to established practices.

### Cutera's Provider Locator

**Cutera** maintains a provider directory on their website. Search by zip code to find clinics using Enlighten systems. The directory doesn't always distinguish between Enlighten II and Enlighten III — confirm the specific model during your consultation call.

### Questions for Your Consultation

When evaluating an Enlighten III clinic, ask:

**"Which Enlighten model do you use?"** The Enlighten II lacks the 670nm wavelength. If your tattoo contains green or certain blue pigments, the III is meaningfully superior. The II remains capable for black, red, and dark blue.

**"Do you use both picosecond and nanosecond modes?"** Some practitioners default to one mode exclusively. The platform's advantage lies in switching between modes based on treatment stage. A practitioner using only picosecond mode is paying for capabilities they're not leveraging.

**"What wavelength will you use for my specific colors?"** The answer should reference specific nanometer values and explain why each wavelength matches your ink. Generic answers like "the laser handles all colors" suggest limited technical understanding.

**"How many Enlighten treatments have you performed?"** Platform-specific experience matters. A practitioner with 500 Enlighten sessions will optimize parameters better than one who recently acquired the device.

### Pricing Expectations

Enlighten III sessions typically price between PicoSure and PicoWay rates:

**Small tattoos (under 3 square inches):** $200-350 per session
**Medium tattoos (3-6 square inches):** $350-550 per session
**Large tattoos (6+ square inches):** $550-900 per session

These ranges reflect the platform's premium positioning. Clinics investing in Enlighten III systems pass equipment costs through to patients, though the per-session premium may be offset by fewer total sessions compared to Q-Switch alternatives.

## Treatment Protocols: How Practitioners Use the Enlighten III

The Enlighten III's flexibility translates to clinical value only when practitioners leverage its full capability. Understanding typical treatment protocols helps you evaluate whether your provider is maximizing the platform's potential.

### Sequential Wavelength Treatment

For multicolor tattoos, practitioners typically address different pigments within the same session by switching handpieces. A common sequence for a tattoo containing black, red, and green elements:

1. 1064nm picosecond for black areas
2. 532nm picosecond for red areas
3. 670nm picosecond for green and blue areas

Each wavelength requires handpiece changes and parameter adjustments, extending session time. A multicolor Enlighten III session may last 30-45 minutes versus 15-20 minutes for a single-color treatment.

### Pulse Mode Staging

Experienced practitioners stage pulse mode selection across the treatment timeline:

**Sessions 1-3 (dense ink):** Nanosecond mode at higher fluence to break apart large, dense particle clusters. The thermal component is advantageous when maximum energy delivery outweighs finesse requirements.

**Sessions 4-8 (moderate density):** Transition to picosecond mode. Smaller particles from initial sessions respond better to photomechanical fragmentation. Lower fluence settings reduce cumulative thermal load.

**Sessions 9+ (residual ink):** Picosecond mode at carefully calibrated fluence. The remaining particles are small, scattered, and may require spot-specific parameter adjustment. The practitioner's experience with the platform matters most in this final refinement phase.

### Treatment for Sensitive Skin Types

The Enlighten III's 1064nm picosecond mode at conservative fluence provides the safest treatment for Fitzpatrick IV-V skin types. The 670nm handpiece, while riskier than 1064nm on darker skin, carries less melanin interference than the 532nm wavelength — giving practitioners a middle-ground option for addressing blue-green pigments in patients where 532nm would be contraindicated.

This graduated safety profile across three wavelengths allows practitioners to treat more pigment colors safely on darker skin compared to platforms with only two wavelength options.

## Who Benefits Most From the Enlighten III

The Enlighten III isn't universally superior. It excels in specific scenarios.

**Multicolor tattoos with green or blue:** The 670nm wavelength gives the Enlighten III a direct tool for these stubborn colors without requiring a second laser system.

**Cover-up tattoos with dense layering:** The dual-pulse capability allows practitioners to use heavier nanosecond pulses for initial layer penetration, then refine with picosecond precision. Neither PicoSure nor PicoWay offers this flexibility.

**Patients with medium-dark skin (Fitzpatrick III-IV):** The three-wavelength range allows practitioners to select the safest wavelength for each ink color while minimizing melanin absorption across the treatment plan.

**Patients seeking a single-provider solution:** Clinics with an Enlighten III can handle virtually any tattoo configuration without referring patients elsewhere for specific colors. Continuity of care simplifies scheduling and reduces total treatment duration.

The platform is less advantageous for simple black tattoos on lighter skin, where any picosecond system delivers comparable results. If your tattoo is black ink on Fitzpatrick I-II skin, the specific laser brand matters less than the practitioner's experience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the Enlighten III better than PicoSure for tattoo removal?

Neither system is categorically better. The Enlighten III offers broader wavelength coverage (three wavelengths versus PicoSure's primary 755nm) and dual pulse modes. **PicoSure** remains the benchmark for green ink removal specifically due to its 755nm alexandrite laser. For multicolor tattoos, the Enlighten III's versatility provides an advantage. For predominantly green or blue tattoos, PicoSure matches or exceeds its performance.

### How many sessions does the Enlighten III typically require?

Session count depends on your tattoo's characteristics, not just the laser platform. Amateur black tattoos average 3-6 sessions. Professional multicolor work averages 8-14 sessions. These numbers are consistent with other picosecond platforms and represent a 30-40% reduction compared to Q-Switch nanosecond-only systems, based on published data in dermatology literature.

### Does the Enlighten III work on all skin types?

The 1064nm wavelength is safe for all Fitzpatrick skin types (I-VI). The 532nm and 670nm wavelengths carry elevated risk for darker skin due to melanin absorption. Practitioners should conduct test patches on Fitzpatrick IV-VI patients before committing to treatment protocols using shorter wavelengths. The Enlighten III's wavelength versatility actually benefits darker-skinned patients by providing safer wavelength options when treating specific ink colors.

### What does Enlighten III treatment feel like?

Patients describe the sensation as a rapid series of hot rubber band snaps, consistent with other picosecond laser platforms. The picosecond mode may feel slightly less intense than nanosecond mode due to reduced thermal accumulation. Most clinics offer topical lidocaine numbing cream applied 30-45 minutes before treatment. Some facilities provide injectable lidocaine or cooling devices for pain management. For a comprehensive overview of pain expectations, see [Tattoo Removal Pain: What to Expect](/articles/tattoo-removal-pain.html).

### Is the Enlighten III available in my area?

Availability depends on your market. Major metro areas (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, Miami) typically have multiple Enlighten III providers. Smaller markets and rural areas may not have any. Use **Cutera**'s provider locator as a starting point, then confirm the specific model (Enlighten II vs. III) during your consultation call. If no Enlighten III is available locally, **PicoWay** and **PicoSure** offer comparable performance for most tattoo types. The specific platform matters less than the practitioner's expertise with their equipment.

### How much does Enlighten III tattoo removal cost?

Per-session pricing ranges from $200 for small tattoos to $900+ for large pieces, positioning the Enlighten III in the mid-to-upper tier of removal costs. Total treatment cost depends on session count, which varies by tattoo complexity. A small black amateur tattoo might cost $600-2,100 total over 3-6 sessions. A large professional multicolor piece could reach $7,000-12,600 over 8-14 sessions. Package deals reduce per-session cost by 10-20% at most clinics. See [Tattoo Removal Cost: 2026 Pricing Data](/articles/tattoo-removal-cost.html) for market-specific pricing.
