# Tattoo Removal Consultation: 40 Questions to Ask Before Your First Session

A consultation appointment serves two purposes. The clinic evaluates your tattoo, skin type, and medical history to propose a treatment plan. You evaluate whether this clinic deserves your trust, money, and 18 months of repeated visits.

Most patients show up unprepared. They accept whatever information the clinic volunteers, sign paperwork they barely read, and commit to packages before understanding what they're buying. The clinic controls the conversation because the patient brought no framework.

This article provides that framework. Forty questions organized across seven categories: provider qualifications, technology and equipment, treatment plan assessment, pricing and financial terms, safety and contraindications, pain management options, and aftercare support. Print this list. Bring it to every consultation. Take notes on the answers.

The clinic that welcomes your questions is demonstrating confidence in their operation. The one that treats your preparation as an inconvenience is revealing something about how they'll treat you throughout treatment.

## Provider Qualifications

The person firing a laser at your skin determines outcome quality more than the equipment they're using. A $200,000 PicoWay produces mediocre results when operated by someone with weekend certification. These questions establish whether the provider possesses genuine expertise.

### Licensing and Board Certification

**Question 1:** What license does the person performing my treatment hold?

State regulations vary. Some require physician supervision. Others allow licensed aestheticians to operate lasers independently. You need to know what category your operator falls into and whether that satisfies the legal requirements in your state.

**Question 2:** Is the treating physician board-certified in dermatology or another relevant specialty?

The **American Board of Dermatology** certifies physicians who complete accredited residency programs and pass rigorous examinations. Board certification is publicly verifiable at certificationmatters.org. A claim without verification is just marketing.

**Question 3:** Can you provide the license number so I can verify it with the state medical board?

Every licensed medical professional appears in state databases. These records show active status, expiration dates, disciplinary actions, and practice restrictions. Running this search takes three minutes and reveals information clinics never volunteer.

### Years of Experience with Laser Removal

**Question 4:** How many years has this clinic offered laser tattoo removal?

Longevity indicates operational stability. A clinic operating for eight years has navigated equipment transitions, staff turnover, and thousands of patient cases. A six-month-old operation lacks that track record regardless of staff credentials.

**Question 5:** How many laser removal procedures has my specific operator performed?

The operator's personal volume matters more than clinic volume. Someone who has performed 2,000 treatments recognizes complication onset patterns that someone with 50 treatments will miss. Ask for specific numbers, not vague descriptors.

**Question 6:** What percentage of their practice is dedicated to tattoo removal versus other laser procedures?

A dermatologist performing removal twice monthly operates differently than a technician doing it daily. Specialization breeds pattern recognition. You want someone who sees your tattoo characteristics regularly.

### Continuing Education and Training

**Question 7:** What continuing education has the operator completed in the past two years?

Laser technology evolves. Treatment protocols improve. Operators who stopped learning after initial certification are delivering outdated care. Look for attendance at ASLMS conferences, manufacturer training updates, or formal coursework.

**Question 8:** Does the operator hold manufacturer certification for the specific laser they'll use on me?

Device manufacturers offer training programs specific to their equipment. A provider using Candela's PicoWay should have Candela training documentation. Operating unfamiliar equipment on patients crosses professional boundaries.

### Complication Management Protocols

**Question 9:** What complications have you seen in your practice, and how were they managed?

A provider claiming zero complications is either lying or inexperienced. Burns, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and allergic reactions occur in laser removal. You want someone who has encountered these situations and resolved them, not someone who will see their first complication on your skin.

**Question 10:** If I experience a complication, who treats it and at what cost?

Some clinics refer complications elsewhere, leaving you to navigate the healthcare system and pay additional specialists. Others handle complications in-house at no additional charge. The answer reveals their accountability structure.

## Technology and Equipment

Marketing claims about laser technology frequently misrepresent reality. These questions separate genuine technological capability from sales language.

### Specific Laser Model and Year

**Question 11:** What specific laser model will be used for my treatment?

Acceptable answers include PicoWay, PicoSure, Enlighten, RevLite SI, or MedLite C6. Generic responses like "state-of-the-art picosecond laser" without model identification suggest the clinic prioritizes marketing over technical accuracy.

**Question 12:** What year was this device manufactured?

Laser equipment depreciates through millions of pulses. A 2015 unit has delivered more output degradation than a 2022 unit. Devices beyond seven years of age warrant closer scrutiny about maintenance and calibration.

### Wavelength Capabilities

**Question 13:** What wavelengths does your laser offer?

Different wavelengths target different ink colors. The 1064nm Nd:YAG handles black and dark blue. The 532nm targets red, orange, and yellow. The 755nm Alexandrite addresses green and blue. Your tattoo's colors determine which wavelengths you need.

**Question 14:** Does your equipment allow treating multiple colors in a single session?

Clinics with single-wavelength systems treat one color per session, extending timeline and cost. Multi-wavelength systems treat multiple colors simultaneously. For multicolor tattoos, this distinction significantly affects total treatment duration.

[INTERNAL: multicolor-tattoo-removal] details wavelength-color matching requirements.

### Maintenance and Calibration Schedule

**Question 15:** When was this device last calibrated, and can I see documentation?

Professional maintenance includes annual or semi-annual manufacturer calibration with documented output power verification. Reputable clinics maintain service documentation and provide it without hesitation. Reluctance signals inadequate maintenance.

**Question 16:** Does the clinic maintain an active service contract with the device manufacturer?

Manufacturers sell service contracts covering scheduled maintenance. Lapsed contracts suggest deferred maintenance. A genuine PicoWay that hasn't been calibrated in two years performs worse than a well-maintained Q-Switch.

### FDA Clearance Verification

**Question 17:** Is this device **FDA** cleared for tattoo removal, and can you show me the clearance documentation?

The **FDA** clears laser devices for specific uses after reviewing safety and efficacy data. Verify clearance through the FDA 510(k) database by searching the device model name. Clinics using non-cleared devices operate outside established safety parameters.

**Question 18:** Has this device been modified from its FDA-cleared configuration?

Some operators modify equipment settings or handpieces beyond manufacturer specifications. These modifications void FDA clearance status and create unknown safety profiles. Your skin shouldn't be the test case for experimental configurations.

## Treatment Plan Assessment

The proposed treatment plan reveals whether the clinic is providing honest projections or optimistic estimates designed to close sales.

### Realistic Session Count Estimate

**Question 19:** How many sessions do you estimate for my specific tattoo?

Honest providers give ranges, not guarantees. A response of "8-12 sessions depending on your body's response" demonstrates appropriate uncertainty. A claim of "we'll have this done in 6 sessions" suggests sales pressure over clinical accuracy.

**Question 20:** What variables could push my treatment toward the higher end of that range?

Variables include immune response variation, ink density beyond surface appearance, body location circulation differences, and unknown layering from previous cover-ups. A provider who discusses these factors understands removal complexity.

### Kirby-Desai Scale Score for Your Tattoo

**Question 21:** Have you assessed my tattoo using the **Kirby-Desai scale**, and what score did it receive?

The Kirby-Desai scale provides standardized prediction of session count based on skin type, tattoo location, ink colors, ink amount, scarring, layering, and cover-up history. Each factor receives a numerical score. Total scores correlate with expected sessions.

**Question 22:** Can you walk me through each Kirby-Desai factor and how it applies to my tattoo?

This question tests whether the provider actually uses the scale or just name-drops it. Walking through each factor demonstrates genuine assessment versus superficial familiarity. A provider who can't explain the scoring isn't using it.

### Expected Fade Percentage per Session

**Question 23:** What fade percentage should I expect after each session?

Typical first-session fading ranges 20-40% for black ink. Subsequent sessions produce diminishing returns as remaining ink becomes sparser. Understanding progression prevents disappointment when session 8 shows less dramatic change than session 2.

**Question 24:** At what point will we assess whether the protocol needs adjustment?

Treatment response varies individually. Good clinics build assessment checkpoints into treatment plans: evaluate after sessions 3-4, adjust parameters if response lags expectations. Rigid protocols that ignore individual variation produce suboptimal outcomes.

### Total Timeline (Months/Years)

**Question 25:** What is the realistic total timeline for my removal, including healing intervals between sessions?

Sessions require 6-8 week spacing minimum. A 10-session treatment with 8-week intervals spans 18 months. Add scheduling delays and potential complications, realistic timeline extends to 20-24 months. Providers quoting "under a year" for substantial tattoos are underestimating.

**Question 26:** What factors might extend that timeline beyond your current estimate?

Poor healing, stubborn ink response, complications requiring treatment pauses, or seasonal sun exposure limitations can extend timelines. Understanding potential delays helps you plan appropriately rather than expecting the optimistic case.

## Pricing and Financial

Financial terms vary dramatically across providers. These questions reveal true costs and protect against hidden fees.

### Cost per Session Breakdown

**Question 27:** What is my per-session cost based on my tattoo's size and characteristics?

Get a specific dollar figure tied to your measured tattoo size. Vague responses like "it depends on how it responds" avoid accountability. Your tattoo size is known. Per-session cost should be stated clearly.

**Question 28:** What is included in that per-session price, and what costs extra?

Some clinics include numbing, aftercare supplies, and follow-up consultations. Others charge separately for each component. A $400 session that includes everything differs from a $350 session plus $50 numbing plus $30 aftercare supplies.

### Package Pricing vs Per-Session

**Question 29:** Do you offer package pricing, and how does per-session cost compare?

Package discounts typically range 15-25% off per-session rates. Calculate whether the package discount justifies the upfront commitment, especially if your treatment might require fewer sessions than packaged.

**Question 30:** If I purchase a package and complete removal before using all sessions, what happens to unused sessions?

Some clinics offer credit toward other services. Others forfeit unused sessions entirely. This policy affects whether packages represent good value for your specific situation.

### Refund Policy for Unsatisfactory Results

**Question 31:** What is your refund policy if I'm dissatisfied with results before completing treatment?

Written policies vary from "no refunds" to "prorated refund minus administrative fee." Understand the exit terms before entering a financial commitment. The best clinics offer pro-rata refunds without penalty.

**Question 32:** How do you define "unsatisfactory results" for refund purposes?

Definitions matter. A clinic might define satisfaction by fade percentage achieved, not by your subjective assessment. Clarify the standard before signing any agreement.

### Financing Options Available

**Question 33:** Do you accept CareCredit or other healthcare financing?

**CareCredit** offers promotional financing with 0% APR periods accepted at many clinics. Approval depends on credit score. Understand promotional terms and post-promotional interest rates (typically 26.99%) before committing.

**Question 34:** Do you offer in-house payment plans, and what are the terms?

In-house plans avoid third-party financing but vary widely. Some require 50% deposit. Others allow per-session payment. Negotiate terms during consultation while you have leverage.

## Safety and Contraindications

Safety screening identifies contraindications that affect treatment eligibility and complication risk. Clinics that skip this screening prioritize conversion over patient welfare.

### Medical History Review Thoroughness

**Question 35:** What medical conditions would disqualify me from treatment or require protocol modification?

**Medical contraindications** include active infections, certain autoimmune conditions, compromised immune systems, and healing disorders. A thorough provider identifies these conditions through intake forms and discussion before treatment.

**Question 36:** How long should this medical history review take?

Complete intake requires 10-15 minutes minimum. Consultations that skip directly to pricing without health screening prioritize sales over safety. The absence of medical questions disqualifies a clinic regardless of other factors.

### Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Protocols

**Question 37:** What is your policy on treating patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding?

Most clinics decline treatment during **pregnancy** and breastfeeding due to unknown effects of ink particle absorption and anesthetic agents on fetal development and breast milk. A clinic willing to treat pregnant patients raises safety concerns about their overall protocols.

### Keloid or Hypertrophic Scarring Risk

**Question 38:** How do you assess **keloid scarring** risk, and what modifications do you make for high-risk patients?

**Keloid** and hypertrophic scarring tendencies affect treatment parameters. Conservative settings, test patches, and extended healing intervals reduce scarring risk for susceptible patients. Providers unaware of these modifications lack sufficient training.

### Medication Interactions (Accutane, Photosensitizers)

**Question 39:** What medications require treatment delays or protocol modifications?

Isotretinoin (Accutane) requires 6-12 month waiting periods after discontinuation. Photosensitizing medications increase burn risk. Blood thinners affect healing. If the clinic doesn't ask about Accutane during intake, they're not screening for known complication risks.

## Pain Management Options

Treatment discomfort varies by pain tolerance and body location. Understanding available options helps you plan appropriately.

### Numbing Cream Provision or BYO

**Question 40:** Do you provide topical numbing, or should I bring my own?

Some clinics include numbing in session pricing. Others charge separately ($20-50 per session) or expect you to apply prescription **BLT cream** before arrival. Self-sourcing prescription numbing cream saves $200-400 over a treatment course.

Acceptable answers clarify what's provided, what costs extra, and whether they'll write prescriptions for take-home numbing. Evasive responses about pain management suggest the clinic hasn't developed comprehensive protocols.

### Injectable Anesthesia Availability

For large tattoos or pain-sensitive patients, topical numbing provides insufficient relief. Injectable lidocaine offers stronger numbness but requires provider qualifications to administer.

Ask whether injectable anesthesia is available, who administers it, and what additional cost applies. Typical charges range $75-150 per session. Over 12 sessions, this adds $900-1,800 to total cost.

### Cooling Systems (Zimmer, Cryogen)

Active cooling systems blow cold air on the treatment area, reducing discomfort during and after laser pulses.

The **Zimmer** Cryo cooling device represents the industry standard. Ask whether the clinic uses active cooling, what system they have, and whether it's included in session pricing or charged separately.

Clinics without active cooling rely entirely on topical numbing, producing more discomfort and longer recovery between passes during treatment.

## Aftercare and Support

Post-treatment care determines whether your skin heals optimally or develops complications. These questions assess the support structure.

### Post-Treatment Instructions Clarity

Ask to see written aftercare instructions before committing. Clear instructions include specific timeframes (avoid sun exposure for X weeks), product recommendations (what ointment, how often), and activity restrictions (no swimming/hot tubs for X days).

Vague verbal instructions like "keep it clean and dry" indicate insufficient protocol development. Written instructions demonstrate that the clinic has systematized their aftercare approach.

### Follow-Up Appointments for Complications

Some clinics schedule routine follow-ups after each session to assess healing. Others only see you again at your next treatment appointment.

Ask: If I experience unexpected healing, when can I be seen? Is there a charge for complication follow-ups? Who evaluates whether something is normal versus concerning?

The answers reveal whether complications burden you with additional appointments and costs or whether the clinic treats complication management as part of their service.

### 24/7 Contact for Urgent Concerns

Complications don't occur on schedule. Severe blistering, signs of infection, or allergic reactions can emerge evenings and weekends.

Ask: How do I reach someone if I have urgent concerns outside business hours? Is there an on-call provider? What constitutes an urgent concern versus something that can wait until Monday?

Emergency access expectations vary by clinic type. Dermatology practices may offer physician on-call coverage. Med spas may not. Understanding the support structure helps you know what to expect if something goes wrong.

## Using These Questions

Not every consultation requires all forty questions. Match your questions to your specific concerns and the clinic's apparent weaknesses.

For first consultations, focus on credentials (Questions 1-10) and technology verification (Questions 11-18). These establish baseline legitimacy.

For clinics that pass initial screening, shift to treatment planning (Questions 19-26) and financial terms (Questions 27-34). These reveal whether their approach matches your needs.

For high-risk situations (darker skin, history of scarring, complex multicolor tattoos), emphasize safety screening (Questions 35-39) regardless of other factors.

**Informed consent** means you understand what you're agreeing to. A clinic that rushes through consent paperwork without answering your questions isn't obtaining genuine consent. They're obtaining a signature.

The consultation is your one opportunity to evaluate before committing thousands of dollars and years of your life. The clinic that welcomes your preparation demonstrates confidence in their operation. The one that treats your questions as obstacles is telling you how they'll treat complications later.
